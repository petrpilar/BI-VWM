ed from the membranes of the white blood cells , leukocytes . The ' cloaked ' nanoparticles were fou
nd to behave like leukocytes , are able to evade the body 's immune system and survive much longer .
 The scientists expressed that LLVs are able to overcome a major hurdle in nanomedicine delivery by 
avoiding clearance in blood stream , crossing the biological barriers and localizing at target tissu
es due to its leukocyte like characters . Synthetic membranes are expected to develop in the future 
to replace harvest from the white blood cells due to the limited source of leukocyte. Inhalable nano
carriers were developed using a nanostructured lipid nanocarrier-based system ( NLCS ) . The lipid n
anoparticles contain the drug payload ( doxorubicin or paclitaxel ) two types of small interfering R
NA ( siRNA , targeted the BCL-2 mRNA to suppress nonpump cellular resistance , and MRP1 mRNA to supp
ress pump drug resistance ) and the targeting molecules , an analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing
