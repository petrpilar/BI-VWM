and ten were good rounds for Leonard . Three booming rights from Hearns sent Leonard down for the se
cond time in the fight . Knowing he needed a big finish , Leonard fought furiously and had a big fin
al round . The judges scored the fight a draw , with both boxers retaining their respective titles .
 Judge Jerry Roth scored the fight 113-112 for Hearns , Judge Tom Kazmarek scored it 113-112 for Leo
nard , and Judge Dalby Shirley scored it 112-112 . Shirley was the only judge to give Leonard a 10-8
 margin in the twelfth . If he had scored it 10-9 , as his two colleagues did , Hearns would have wo
n by a split decision . The decision was soundly booed , as most felt that Hearns had won . Eventual
ly , Leonard admitted that Hearns deserved the decision .  There was talk of a third fight , but it 
never happened . Leonard had his attorney , Mike Trainer , pursue a third fight , but Hearns said th
at he could no longer make the weight and was returning to light-heavyweight. s-aft after=W12 Robert
