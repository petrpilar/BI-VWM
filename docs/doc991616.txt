t can result from the expression of recombinant DNA within living cells are termed recombinant prote
ins . When recombinant DNA encoding a protein is introduced into a host organism , the recombinant p
rotein is not necessarily produced . Expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized 
expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructure by foreign coding sequence . Recom
binant DNA differs from genetic recombination in that the former results from artificial methods in 
the test tube , while the latter is a normal biological process that results in the remixing of exis
