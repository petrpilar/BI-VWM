eed does not increase , and below 21 C , the lizards are extremely sluggish . If they are less than 
21 C , they will not flee , but will instead hold their ground and become extremely aggressive . The
 more their body temperatures drop , the more aggressive the lizards become . In contrast , they can
 easily run away from the threat if their body temperatures are high enough to allow for rapid movem
