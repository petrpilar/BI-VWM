eir fixation of carbon dioxide is an important factor in the global budget for carbon dioxide in the
 atmosphere . Satellite images of the Kuroshio Current illustrates how the current path meanders and
 forms isolated rings or eddies on the order of 100&ampndash 300 km . Eddies retain their unique for
m for several months and have their own biological characteristics that depend on where they form . 
If the eddies are formed between the current and coastline of Japan , they may impinge on the contin
ental shelf their high kinetic energy has the effect one side of the ring , while adding water to th
e other side . The eddies size and strength decline with distance from major ocean currents . The am
ount of energy decreases from the rings associated with the major currents and down to eddies remote
 from those currents . Cyclonic eddies have the potential to cause upwelling that would affect the g
lobal primary-production budget . Upwelling brings cold , nutrient-rich water to the surface resulti
