 , the procedure has been applied to the determination of sulfate in brine ( including electrolysis 
brines ) , in nickel refining solutions and particularly for sulfate in wet process phosphoric acid 
, where it has proven to be quite popular . The procedure can also be used to assist in the analysis
 of complex acid mixtures containing sulfuric acid where resorting to titration in non-aqueous media
 is not feasible . The reaction enthalpy for the formation of barium sulfate is a modest 18.8 kJ/mol
 . This can place a restriction on the lower limit of sulfate in a sample which can be analyzed.Titr
ation of aluminium with fluorideThermometric titrimetry offers a rapid solution . A solution of alum
inium is conditioned with acetate buffer and an excess of sodium and potassium ions . Titration with
 sodium or potassium fluoride yields the exothermic precipitation of an insoluble alumino-fluoride s
