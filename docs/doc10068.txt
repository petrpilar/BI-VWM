al Satellite , IRAS ( 1983 )The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) was the first-ever space-ba
sed observatory to perform a survey of the entire sky at infrared wavelengths . It discovered about 
350,000 sources , many of which are still awaiting identification . New discoveries included a dust 
disk around Vega and the first images of the Milky Way Galaxy 's core . IRAS 's life , like that of 
most of infrared satellites that followed after , was limited by its cooling system . To effectively
 work in the infrared domain , the telescope must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures . In IRAS 's c
ase , 73 kilograms of superfluid helium kept the telescope at a temperature of 2 kelvins ( about 271
 C ) by evaporation . The supply of liquid helium was depleted after 10 months on November 22 , 1983
 , causing the telescope temperature to rise and preventing further observations . The spacecraft co
