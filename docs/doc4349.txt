ng 's complexity are its many independent layers of guitar which help give it an aggressive and some
what paranoid feel .Music videoBoth versions of the single contain the Cosmopolitan Bloodloss music 
video which found marginal airplay on music TV networks . Directed by Patrick Hoelk , it features Vi
ncent Gallo and has the band performing in an alley in New York City . Their loud music awakens Gall
o who then begins physically confronting strangers as he walks the streets of New York . He eventual
ly finds the alley the band is performing in , walks up to them , and unplugs their equipment just b
efore the song is finished . He then gives them a long , angry stare as shot for the video in which 
Gallo walks up to the band , produces a pistol , and shoots each member . It was deemed too violent 
for TV but can be found online .Track listing US version Cosmopolitan Bloodloss &ampndash 3:04Traile
