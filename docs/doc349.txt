m exposure because , in addition to being weakly radioactive , uranium is a toxic metal , If DU part
icles do enter an individual , the type of danger depend on the solubility of the particles . . Brie
fly , inhaled and insoluble means the DU particles will stick around in the lungs and attendant lymp

 inhalation of DU particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of DU-enhanced projectiles with the
ir targets . When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn , they create depleted uranium
