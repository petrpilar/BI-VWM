lution , new handheld line , the Busicom LE-120A , which went on the market in 1971 and was the smal

r Robert Proebsting invented DRAM address multiplexing with the MK4096 4096 X 1 bit DRAM introduced 
in 1973 . Address multiplexing was a revolutionary approach which reduced cost and board space by fi
tting a 4K DRAM into a 16 pin package , while competitors took the evolutionary approach which led t
o a bulky and relatively expensive 22 pin package . Competitors derided the Mostek approach as unnec
essarily complex , but Proebsting understood the future roadmap for DRAM memories would benefit grea
tly if only one new pin were needed for every 4X increase in memory size , instead of the two pins p
