ion kinetics are slow , and direct titrations between titrant and titrand are not possible , indirec
t or back-titrations often can be devised to solve the problem . Catalytically enhanced endpoints ca
n be used in very small and endpoints would not be detected satisfactorily by the titration software
 . The suitability of a particular chemical reaction as a candidate for a thermometric titration pro
cedure can generally be predicted on the basis of the estimated amount of analyte present in the sam
ple and the enthalpy of the reaction . However , other parameters such as the kinetics of the reacti

he outcome . A properly designed experimental program is the most reliable way of determining the vi
ability of a thermometric titration approach . Successful applications for thermometric titrations a
