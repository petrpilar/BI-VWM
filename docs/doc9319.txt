athematical careerLebesgue 's first paper was published in 1898 and was titled Sur l'approximation d
es fonctions . It dealt with Weierstrass ' theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polyn
omials . Between March 1899 and April 1901 Lebesgue published six notes inComptes Rendus .The first 
of these , unrelated to his development of Lebesgue integration , dealt with the extension of Baire 
's theorem to functions of two variables . The next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane ,
 the area a given bound , and the final note gave the definition of Lebesgue integration for some fu
