school 's activities until his death in 1945.20th Century Cochlear ImplantThe cochlear implant is a 
device surgically implanted in the skull that provides stimulation to the nerve to promote hearing .
 It is a prosthetic with wires attached to the cochlea and is located behind the ear . The cochlear 
implant has a microphone , connecting cables , a speech processor , and a battery . The processor co
nverts sounds into electrical impulses by taking information from sound patterns and producing an el
ectrical pulse in the ear of the host . Although the implant does provide an artificial means by whi
ch its hosts can hear , this does not elevate sound . With this implant , sounds are not the same as
 sounds that a hearing person experiences . Since the Cochlear implant is in fact brain surgery , it
 destroys the cochlea in the process of implantation . Teaching recipients to understand the sounds 
they hear takes years and there is no guarantee they will be able to make sense of the information .
