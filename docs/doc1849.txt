nds in -s ( withvosis identical : Vosotros vivs - vos vivs. Vosotros os - vos os. Vosotros hus - vos
 hus . In the imperative , the form forvosis also derived from the second person plural . The latter
 ends always in -d . So for the form forvosthis d is removed , and if the verb has more than one syl
lable , an accent is added to the last vowel : Tened ( vosotros ) - ten ( vos ) Dad ( vosotros ) - d
a ( vos ) . The only exception to these rules is in the verb ir ( to go ) , which does not have an i
mperative form for vos and uses the analogous form of the verb andar , which has a similar meaning ,
 and is regular : Andad - and . In the present subjunctive , the same rules as for the present indic
ative apply , though these forms coexist in Argentina with those for the pronoun t : Que vosotros di
gas - que vos digas . Other tenses always have the same form for vos as for t . Outside Argentina , 
other combinations are possible . For instance , people in Maracaibo may use standardvosotrosendings
