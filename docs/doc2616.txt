regulatory issues . Herbicide-resistant crops : commercial varieties of important agricultural crops
 ( including soy , maize/corn , sorghum , canola , alfalfa and cotton ) have been developed that inc
orporate a recombinant gene that results in resistance to the herbicide glyphosate ( trade nameRound
up) , and simplifies weed control by glyphosate application . These crops are in common commercial u
se in several countries . Insect-resistant crops :Bacillus thuringeiensisis a bacterium insecticidal
 properties . The bacterium has been applied to crops as an insect-control strategy for many years ,
 and this practice has been widely adopted in agriculture and gardening . Recently , plants have bee
n developed that express a recombinant form of the bacterial protein , which may effectively control
 some insect predators . Environmental issues associated with the use of these transgenic crops have
 not been fully resolved .History of recombinant DNAThe idea of recombinant DNA was first proposed b
