nctionality that enhances the delivery of the application .ADN optimization techniques TCP multiplex
ingTCP Multiplexing is loosely based on established connection pooling techniques utilized by applic
ation server platforms to optimize the execution of database queries from within applications . An A
DC establishes a number of connections to the servers in its pool and keeps the connections open . W
hen a request is received by the ADC from the client , the request is evaluated and then directed to
 a server over an existing connection . This has the effect of reducing the overhead imposed by esta
blishing and tearing down the TCP connection with the server , improving the responsiveness of the a
pplication . Some ADN implementations take this technique one step further and also multiplex HTTP a
nd application requests . This has the benefit of executing requests in parallel , which enhances th
e performance of the application .TCP optimizationThere are a number of RFCs which describe mechanis
