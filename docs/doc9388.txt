uclei at high excitation energy ( 4050 MeV , therefore hot ) , leading to a reduced probability of s
urvival from fission . The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 35 ne
utrons . Fusion reactions utilizing 48 Ca nuclei usually produce and are sometimes referred to as wa
rm fusion reactions . This leads , in part , to relatively high yields from these reactions .  238 U
 ( 51 V ,xn ) 289x Uup There are strong indications that this reaction was performed in late 2004 as
 part of a uranium(IV) fluoride target test at the GSI . No reports have been published , suggesting
 that no product atoms were detected , as anticipated by the team .  243 Am ( 48 Ca ,xn ) 291x Uup (
 x=2,3,4 ) This reaction was first performed by the team in Dubna in JulyAugust 2003 . In two separa
te runs , they were able to detect 3 atoms of 288 Uup and a single atom of 287 Uup . The reaction wa
s studied further in June 2004 in an attempt to isolate the descendant 268 Db from the 288 Uup , 15
