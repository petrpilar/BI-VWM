ower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust . The atmosphere of Mars cont
ains a great deal of fine dust particles . Water vapor will condense on the particles , then fall do
wn to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating . When Mars is at its greatest ti
lt or obliquity , up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlat
itudes . This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up 
to around 10 meters thick . When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere 
, it leaves behind dust , which insulating the support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are assoc
iated with gullies . Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow . Higher elevations ha
ve far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude
 . Very few gullies are found in the Thaumasia region however , a few are present in the lower eleva
