han kings as we understand that title today , and what was to become Sweden , Norway and Denmark in 
amodernsense , were a number of petty kingdoms whose borders changed constantly as the kings killed 
each other , and had the local assemblies accept them as kings . The politics of these early kingdom
s are retold inBeowulf and the Norse sagas . One of the most powerful kings was the Swedish king who
 according to early sources only ruled what is today eastern Svealand . It is unknown when it happen

 the Swedish kings include Vstergtland and other parts of Gtaland . This stage is by some considered
 to be the beginning of Sweden , as we know it today .See also Sami history Prehistoric SwedenNotes
