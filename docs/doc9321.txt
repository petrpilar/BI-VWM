 If the sequence f n ( x ) increases to the limit f(x) , the integral of f n ( x ) tends to the inte
gral of f(x) . Lebesgue shows that his conditions lead to the theory of measure and measurable funct
ions and the analytical and geometrical definitions of the integral . He turned next to trigonometri
c functions with his 1903 paper Sur les sries trigonomtriques . He presented three major theorems in
 this work : that a trigonometrical series representing a bounded function is a Fourier series , tha
t the n th Fourier coefficient tends to zero ( the RiemannLebesgue lemma ) , and that a Fourier seri
es is integrable term by term . In 1904-1905 Lebesgue lectured once again at the Collge de France , 
this time on trigonometrical series and he went on to publish his lectures in another of the Borel t
racts . In this tract he once again treats the subject in its historical context . He expounds on Fo
urier series , Cantor-Riemann theory , the Poisson , Reprsentation trigonomtrique approche des fonct
