 splined include ISIS Drive , Truvativ GXP and Howitzer , Shimano 's Octalink and many others , most
 of which are proprietary . Some cranksets feature modular spiders , where torque is transmitted thr
ough splines . Cassettes engage the the others to enforce a fixed orientation . Disc brake mounting 
interfaces that are splined include Centerlock , by Shimano . Aircraft engines may have a spline upo
n which mounts the propeller . There may be a master spline which is wider than the others , so that
 the propeller may go on at only one orientation , to maintain dynamic balance . This arrangement is
 commonly found in larger engines , whereas smaller engines typically use a pattern of threaded fast
eners instead .ManufacturingThere are two types of splines , internal and external . External spline
s may be broached , shaped ( for example on a gear shaping machine ) , milled , hobbed , rolled , gr
ound or extruded . There are fewer methods available for manufacturing internal splines due to acces
