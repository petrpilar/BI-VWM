ersecretary for Foreign Affairs Dr Alfred Zimmermann ( not to be confused with Arthur Zimmerman , Ge
rman Secretary for Foreign Affairs ) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German governmen
t : From the Germans ' perspective , had they released Cavell , there would have been a surge in the
 number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely 
punished . It was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the wor
lds condemnation . Their laws do not make distinctions between sexes , the only exception to this ru
le being ( probably this means pregnant ) condition could not be executed . The German government al
so believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts . The
 court paid particular attention to this point , releasing several accused persons because there was
 doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable.Burial and memorialsCavell
