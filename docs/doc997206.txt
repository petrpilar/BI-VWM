 following the expulsion . Garton 's first book was Rashi 's commentary on the written Torah . This 
was printed in the city of Reggio di Calabria , in February , 1475 . Although Garton 's book is the 
first dated printed edition , the work is neither the first edition of Rashi 's commentary , nor the
 first book to be printed in Hebrew . Between 1469 and 1472 three brothers , Obadiah , Menasseh , an
d Benjamin of Rome , were active as the first Hebrew typographers . Six works are positively known t
o have come off their press , among which was the first , albeit undated edition of Rashi 's comment
ary . Nonetheless , the 1475 time , a typeface based on a Sephardic semicursive hand . It was this s
ame style of typeface that a few years later , when commentary and text were incorporated onto one p
age , would be used to distinguish Rabbinic commentary from the text proper . Ultimately , this type
face would be known as Rashi script . Recorded = 9 November 1969 , Oakland County Coliseum , Oakland
