r have been caught in the Lower Mole below Dorking since the 1980s . In the Mole Gap between Dorking
 and Leatherhead the river supports populations of chub , dace , barbel , brown trout . Both barbel 
and brown trout are extremely sensitive to water quality and pollution . Below Leatherhead the river
 has historically supported larger predatory fish including chub , perch , pike , and eels , however
 in . North of Esher the old river channel is dominated by floating pennywort , a highly invasive we
ed , which cuts off all light to the river bed , reducing oxygen levels and resulting in a poor habi
tat for fish . The Ember flood relief channel has a diverse fish population , including chub , dace 
, roach , bleak , large pike and barbel . At the confluence of the Mole and the River Thames at Hamp
ton Court Palace it is possible to catch a wide variety of coarse fish species . The geographical di
stribution of many species of invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area .
