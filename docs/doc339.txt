 and also in the 20 mm M197 gun mounted on AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships . The United States Navy '
s Phalanx CIWS 's M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used 20 mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding
 plastic sabots made using depleted uranium , later changed to tungsten . Another use of depleted ur
anium is in kinetic energy penetrators , anti-armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired fro
m the British Challenger 1 , Challenger 2 , M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams . Kinetic energy penetrator rounds 
consist of a long , relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot . Staballoys are met
al alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals , usually titanium or mol
ybdenum . One formulation has a composition of 99.25% titanium . Staballoys are approximately 1.67 t
imes as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunitio
n . The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium . According to 2005 research , at leas
