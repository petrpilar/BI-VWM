 NaH 2 AsO 4  . H 2 O. Related salts are also called sodium arsenate , including Na 2 HAsO 4 and Na 
3 AsO 4 . This particular salt is a colorless solid that is highly toxic . The potassium salt has si
milar properties . The salt is the conjugate base of arsenic acid : : H 3 AsO 4 H 2 AsO + H + ( K 1 
= 10 2.19 ) It is prepared in this way and crystallized by cooling a hot saturated aqueous solution 
, where it is highly soluble when hot ( 75.3 g in 100 mL at 100 C ) . A fine white powder of the mon
ohydrate crystallizes . Upon heating , the solid loses water of crystallization and then the dihydro
genarsenate anions condense to give Na 2 H 2 As 2 O 7 . Raining on Sunday is a song co-written by co
