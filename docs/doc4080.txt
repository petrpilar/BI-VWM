y in dams as well . The dam 's light weight and prefabricated components must have made assembly eas
y relative to the laborious job of quarrying and setting stone . Steel dams use relatively thin stee
l plates in contact with the water surface , with a framework of steel behind them transmitting the 
load to the ground . The plates are slanted upwards in the direction of water flow , so that the wei
ght of the water puts compressive forces on the girders holding the plates up . This a vertical wall
 of plates would engender . It was believed that these dams could be constructed faster and more che
aply than masonry dams .LocationThe dam lies about 3 mi to the east of Ash Fork , in Johnson Canyon 
, and about 15 mi west of Williams , Arizona . It is near the former U.S. Route 66 and Interstate 40
 . About a mile upstream lies Stone Dam , a masonry structure constructed 13 years later . The Grand
 Canyon Railway originates in Williams , branching from the ATSF main that this dam served , and run
