tion states the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 ( VA ) in the Per
iodic Table , below bismuth . In this group , each member is known to portray the group oxidation st
ate of +V but with differing stability . For nitrogen , the +V state is very difficult to achieve du
e to the lack of low-lying d-orbitals and the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate fi
ve ligands . The +V state is well represented for phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony . However , fo
r bismuth it is rare due to the reluctance of the 6s 2 electrons to participate in bonding . This ef
fect is known as the inert pair effect and is commonly linked to relativistic stabilisation of the 6
s-orbitals . It is expected that ununpentium will continue this trend and portray only +III and +I o
xidation states . Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and ununpentium(I) is likely to show
 some unique properties . Because of spin-orbit coupling , flerovium may display closed-shell or nob
