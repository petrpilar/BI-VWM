des blades whose stiffness and cross-section vary along their length . Their low loading and rigid ,
 hingeless design allows for changing RPM between 140 to 350 using a two-speed transmission to optim
ize efficiency at different speeds and altitudes , a technique called optimum speed rotor technology
 , invented by Abe Karem . It is primarily because of these features that the Hummingbird can fly wi
th less power - and thus use less fuel - than comparable conventional helicopters , which only adjus
t blade pitch and keep the rotor at constant rpm . In August 2005 , Frontier Systems - by then a Boe
ing subsidiary - received a $50 million contract from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division
 to assess the military utility and affordability of a long-range VTOL UAV employing a wide variety 
of adaptable payloads . In October 2007 , DARPA awarded Boeing a $6.3 million contract to deliver an
 A160T aircraft and modified pod for the . In 2008 , DARPA considered stub wings carrying weapons .O
