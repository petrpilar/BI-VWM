 occur on faults near plate margins . By definition , intraplate earthquakes do not occur near plate
 boundaries , but along faults in the normally stable interior of plates . These earthquakes often o
ccur at the location of ancient failed rifts , because such old structures may present a weakness in
 the crust where it can easily slip to accommodate regional tectonic strain . Compared to earthquake
s near plate boundaries , intraplate earthquakes are not well understood , and the hazards associate
d with them may be difficult to quantify .Historic examplesHistoric examples of intraplate earthquak
es include those in Mineral , Virginia in 2011 ( estimated magnitude 5.8 ) , New Madrid in 1811 and 
1812 ( estimated magnitude as high as 8.1 ) , the Boston ( Cape Ann ) earthquake of 1755 ( estimated
 magnitude 6.0 to 6.3 ) , earthquakes felt in New York City in 1737 and 1884 ( both quakes estimated
 at about 5.5 magnitude ) , and the Charleston earthquake in South Carolina in 1886 ( estimated magn
