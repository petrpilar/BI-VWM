ced great growth in recent decades . Non Destructive Testing ( NDT ) in aerospace has a special driv
er of its own due to the high levels of human traffic involved the crash of a civil life reaching ca
tastrophic proportions . Therefore , strict NDT specifications have been set to detect very small cr
acks and defects in engine turbo discs , blades and airframe structures , in both production and ong
oing maintenance . Security Digital Radiography ( DR ) has existed in various forms ( for example , 
CCD and amorphous Silicon imagers ) in the security X-ray inspection field for over 20 years and is 
rapidly replacing the use of film for inspection X-rays in the Security and NDT fields . DR has open
ed a window of opportunity for the aerospace NDT industry due to several key advantages including ex
