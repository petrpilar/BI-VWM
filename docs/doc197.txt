ce University under Prof. Jennifer West , have demonstrated the use of 120 nm diameter nanoshells co
ated with gold to kill cancer tumors in mice . The nanoshells can be targeted to bond to cancerous c
ells by conjugating antibodies or peptides to the nanoshell surface . By irradiating the area of the
 tumor with an infrared laser , which passes through flesh without heating it , the gold is heated s
ufficiently to cause death to the cancer cells . Limitations to , and lack of solubility . Nanoparti
cles have the potential to overcome these problems . Nanoparticles of cadmium selenide ( quantum dot
s ) glow when exposed to ultraviolet light . When injected , they seep into cancer tumors . The surg
eon can see the glowing tumor , and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal . In photodyna
mic therapy , a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside . 
The light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal , energy from the light will he
