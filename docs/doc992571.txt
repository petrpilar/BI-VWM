ssages which describe the appreciation of flowers used in this way . Not satisfied with merely appre
ciating flowers in a vase , Japanese people in the early 15th century tried to give wider meaning to
 placing flowers in a vase . An earlier attitude of passive appreciation developed into a more deepl
y considered approach . This approach forms the basis of what we call ikebana today . According to a
 15th-century manuscript , the two of the most popular flower arrangers of the time were the Ikenobo
 master Senkei and Ryu-ami , a tea master . Unzen recorded the name Senkei in his event and tea jour
nal called Hekizan Nichiroku . In an entry dated February 25 of the third year of the Kansh era ( 14
62 ) , Unzen Taigyoku wrote , at the invitation of Shunko , Senkei made a floral arrangement in a go
lden vase and denizens of Kyoto with refined tastes vied to see his work . This written record marks
 the starting point for 550 years of recorded Ikebana history . Additional historical documentation
