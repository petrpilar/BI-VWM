graduated from gymnasium in Horn in 1892 . He studied physics at the University of Vienna and attend
ed the University of Leipzig for one year . He obtained his PhD in 1896 for work with Franz Serafin 
Exner and completed his habilitation in 1900 . In 1897 , Meyer became assistant of Ludwig Boltzmann 
at the Institute for Theoretical Physics , University of Vienna . His research was dedicated to magn
etic permeability of liquids . After a talk of Friedrich Oskar Giesel a pioneer in of radium from Gi
esel to determine magnetic properties of the new element . Meyer and his colleague Egon von Schweidl
er were able to show that the Becquerel rays ( beta rays ) could be deflected by magnetic fields thi
s effect was discovered simultaneously by several scientists , but Meyeret al .also showed that the 
radiation from polonium ( alpha rays ) behaved differently in the magnetic field . Meyer was able to
 organize the production of 4 grams of radium , as recommended in 1901 by the Austrian Academy of Sc
