 shorter papers were Synostoses of the Cranial Bones regarded as a Race Character ( Nat . Hist . Rev
. 1865 ) , and Weight of the Human Brain ( Journ. of Ment . Science , 1868 ) . Thurnam recognised th
e importance of the obliteration of the sutures of the skull , which he had observed in the dolichoc
ephalous crania of the Stone Age , but not in the brachycephalous crania of the bronze period . His 
conclusion was that this is a strictly race character The free-fall time is the characteristic time 
that would take a body to collapse under its own gravitational attraction , if no other forces exist
ed to oppose the collapse . As such , it plays a fundamental role in setting the timescale for a wid
e variety of astrophysical processesfrom star formation to helioseismology to supernovaein which gra
vity plays a dominant role .Derivation Infall to a point source of gravityIt is relatively simple to
 derive the free-fall time by applying nothing more than Kepler 's Third Law of planetary motion to
