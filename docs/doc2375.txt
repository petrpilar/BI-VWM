itives , have been developed to promote the differentiation toward mesoderm and endoderm lineages . 
As a result of the three-dimensional EB structure , complex morphogenesis occurs during EB different
iation , including the appearance of both epithelial- and mesenchymal-like cell populations , as wel
l as the appearance of markers associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . Addit
ionally , the inductive effects resulting from signaling between cell populations in EBs results in 
spatially and temporally defined changes , which promote complex morphogenesis . Tissue-like structu
res are often exhibited within EBs , including the appearance of blood islands reminiscent of early 
blood vessel structures in the developing embryo , as well as the patterning of neurite extensions (
 indicative of neuron organization ) and spontaneous contractile activity ( indicative substrates su
