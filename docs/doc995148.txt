ing because in the first place , grade A second best grade in the GCE A Level to the top grade in HK
AL is not very useful and objective . Moreover , it is important to note that because of the signifi
cantly different measurement methodologies , these examinations are not directly comparable in terms
 of the skills and knowledge demonstrated at each grade and that distinction rates alone can not ser
ve as a fair indicator of one 's absolute academic performance . In that NARIC research , only the c
umulative percentages were taken into account to reach the huge generalisations , on the very unsafe
 assumption that two scales are exactly identical and standardised . The wide recognition for both q
ualifications in many local universities and companies all attests to this . For example , many pres
tigious overseas universities regard the HK qualifications ( HKCEE and HKALE ) as being equivalent t
o the UK ones ( IGCSE and GCEAL ) on a grade-by-grade basis birthplace = Barrie , ON , CAN Bruce Gar
