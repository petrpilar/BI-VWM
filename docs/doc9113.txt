nting an immune response from being triggered .ArthroscopeNanotechnology is helping to advance the u
se of arthroscopes , which are pencil-sized devices that can do the surgeries with smaller incisions
 . The smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients . It is al
so helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair .Diagnostic and medica
l devicesNanotechnology-on-a-chip is one more dimension of lab-on-a-chip technology . Magnetic nanop
articles , bound to a suitable antibody , are used to label specific molecules , structures or micro
organisms . Gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of DNA can be used for detection of geneti
c sequence in a sample . Multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedd
ing different-sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads . Nanopore technology for analysis of nuc
leic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures . C-dots ( Cornell do
