the sharpness of the endpoint is dependent on the magnitude of the enthalpy change . If it is unfavo
urable , the endpoint will be rounded regardless of the magnitude of the enthalpy change . Reactions
 where non-stoichiometric equilibria are evident can be used to obtain satisfactory results using a 
thermometric titration approach . If the portions of the titration curve both prior to and after the
 endpoint are reasonably linear , then the intersection of tangents to these lines will accurately l
ocate the endpoint . This is illustrated in Figure 2 . Consider the reaction for the equationaA +bno
n-stoichiometric at equilibrium . Let A represent the titrant , and B the titrand . At the beginning
 of the titration , the titrand B is strongly in excess , and the reaction is pushed towards complet
ion . Under these conditions , for a constant rate of titrant addition the temperature increase is c
onstant and the curve is essentially linear until the endpoint is approached . In a similar manner ,
