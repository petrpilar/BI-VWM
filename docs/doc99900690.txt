anic compound has similarities to sporopollenin , but is unique to dinoflagellates . Resistant biopo
lymers are non-hydrolyzable and fossilizable macromolecular organic compounds present in many microa
lgal cell walls and fossil palynomorphs . Thus far , only the motile stage ofGymnodinium catenatumha
s been shown to produce the highly aliphatic biopolymer algaenan . Dinosporin has been shown to be a
 significantly different biopolymer from algaenan , which demonstrates that dinoflagellates are able
 to produce a completely different biomacromolecule for their resting cysts . Previous descriptions 
of dinosporin having similar properties to sporopollenin were based on both compounds resistance to 
hydrolysis and high preservation potential . However , further research has instead shown that dinos
porin is compositionally distinct . Despite the clear distinction between dinosporin and other resis
tant biopolymer groups , very little is known about the actual structure of dinosporin . A recent '
