e , phosphorus , boron , and a host of other elements . In addition to simple absorption experiments
 , it is also possible to determine the rate of fast atom exchange reactions through suppression exc
hange measurements , interatomic distances through multidimensional nuclear overhauser effect experi
ments , and through-bond spin-spin coupling through homonuclear correlation spectroscopy . In additi
on to the spin excitation properties of nuclei , it is also possible to study the properties of orga
nic radicals through the same fundamental technique . Unpaired electrons also have a net spin , and 
an external magnetic field allows for the extraction of similar information through electron paramag
netic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopy.Vibrational spectroscopyVibrational spectroscopy , or infrared 
( IR ) spectroscopy , allows for the identification of functional groups and , due to its low expens
e and robustness , is often used in teaching labs and the real-time monitoring of reaction progress
