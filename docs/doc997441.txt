f Michele 's cover of Taking Chances was released as a single , available for digital download and f
eatures on the albumGlee : The Music , Volume 1. The scene in which Kurt comes out to his father was
 based on the personal experience of series creator Ryan Murphy . Murphy 's intention was to move aw
ay from previous shows he has worked on in which gay characters have not been given happy endings , 
by allowing Kurt to succeed and be accepted . The episode was watched by 6.64 million United States 
viewers and received mixed reviews from critics . Shawna Malcom of theLos Angeles Timespraised the s
how 's fast pacing , however felt that key characters were not given enough screen time . The footba
ll team 's performance of Single Ladies and Kurt 's coming out to his father were generally well rec
eived , however Rachel 's actions garnered little sympathy , and several reviewers commented negativ
ely on Quinn 's pregnancy , with Eric Goldman of IGN deeming it a very soap opera plotline .PlotGlee
