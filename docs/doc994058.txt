d find stables , economic buildings , and residences for parts of the palace staff . The palace itse
lf spanned over a 80x75m piece of ground - about the size of Kronborg , and a bit bigger than Snderb
org Castle . Shortly after the completion of Hansborg , it was decided that the castle should be cal
led by the original name , Haderslevhus -- presumably to follow the old systematic naming of castles
 in trade cities at the time . So , actually , the castle was only called Hansborg in the short peri
od of time between 1562 to about 1590 . Otherwise , the castles has always been spoken of the castle
 as headquarters in 1627-1629 , and the building was severely damaged . In 1629-1642 a lot of recons
truction took place , but the castle was invaded by Torstenson 's troops in 1643-1645 , and in 1644 
, the castle caught fire , and burned to the ground . After this catastrophe , many of the bricks wa
s used for the construction of the Danish Royal Library , and therefore a castle was never rebuilt .
