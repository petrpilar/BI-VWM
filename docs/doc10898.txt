Given the importance of reasoning about statistical inference and difficulties that students have wi
th this type of reasoning , statistics educators and researchers have been exploring alternative app
roaches towards teaching statistical inference . Recent research suggests that students have some so
und intuitions about data and these intuitions can be refined and nudged towards prescriptive theory
