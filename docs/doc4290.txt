a syadash- do n't sit down . ( See section onintentional particles. )Word orderAlthough Bulgarian ha
s almost no noun cases its word order is rather free . It is even freer than the word order of some 
languages that have cases , for example German . This is due to the agreement between the subject an
d the verb of a sentence . So in Bulgarian the sentence I saw Lubomir can be expressed thus : . saw-
1pSg Lyubomir ( ) . Lyubomir ( him ) saw-1pSg It is clear that the subject is ( I ) ( it has been dr
opped ) , because the verb is in the first person singular . Other examples - Ivan greeted the girls
 : . Ivan greeted-3pSg girls-the . ( ) . Girls-the ( them ) greeted-3pSg Ivan . . Ivan girls-the gre
eted-3pSg . ( ) . Girls-the Ivan ( them ) Greeted-3pSg ( them ) girls-the Ivan . Theoretically all p
ermutations are possible but the last one sounds rather odd . The girls greeted Ivan : . Girls-the g
reeted-3pPl Ivan . ( ) . Ivan ( him ) greeted-3pPl girls-the . . Girls-the Ivan greeted-3pPl . ( ) .
