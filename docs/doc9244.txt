rounds had been forgotten because they were used in a highly classified program and had been fired b

ilabilityNatural uranium metal contains about 0.71% U-235 , 99.28% U-238 , and about 0.0054% U-234 .
 In order to produce enriched uranium , the process of isotope separation removes a substantial port
ion of the U-235 for use in nuclear power , weapons , or other uses . The remainder ,depleted uraniu
m, contains only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235 . Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U
-235 , enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium . For example kg of natural uranium 
, and leaves about 10.8 kg of depleted uranium with only 0.3% U-235 remaining . The Nuclear Regulato
