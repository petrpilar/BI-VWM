dation by herbivores , can also be indirect drivers for cyclic succession if they differentially mod
ulate plant life history properties over time . Density-dependent root gnawing by rodents is propose
d as one such mechanism in the Larrea-Opuntia system . Watt noted that cyclic fluctuations in mortal
ity rate could also be produced through differential response to seasonal conditions like frost . It
 is important to note that patterns cyclic succession can not be readily linked to any single specie
s , as WattsCallunabushes have been observed in non-cyclic systems . Rather , it is the aggregate co
mposition of species that gives rise to the cyclic process .Additional empirical evidenceStrong empi
rical evidence for cyclic succession can be found in Watts follow-up publication on the bracken syst
em in the Journal of Ecology .Calluna vulgarisandPteridium aquilinumwere found to replace each other
 . Another salient example of cyclic replacement occurs in a water availability is limiting such tha
