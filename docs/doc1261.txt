at higher energy levels the lifetime can be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy . When operate
d below 30% of the explosion energy , flashtube lifetime is generally between a few million to tens 
of millions of flashes .ApplicationsAs the duration of the flash that is emitted by a xenon flashtub
e can be accurately controlled , and due to the high intensity of the light , xenon flashtubes are c
ommonly used as photographic strobe lights . Xenon flashtubes are also used in very high speed or st
op-motion photography , which was pioneered by Harold Edgerton in the 1930s . Because they can gener
ate bright attention-getting flashes with a relatively small continuous input of electrical power , 
they are also used in aircraft warning lights , emergency vehicle lighting , fire alarm annunciator 
devices (horn lights) , aircraft anticollision beacons , and other similar applications . In dentist
ry it is used in so called Light Box device to light activate materials ( for example Megaflash mini
