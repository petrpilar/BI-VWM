m physical changes in the environment . However , broader cyclic processes can also be observed in c
ases of secondary succession in which regular disturbances such as insect outbreaks can reset an ent
ire community to a previous stage . These examples differ from the classic cases of cyclic successio
n discussed below in that entire species groups are exchanged , as opposed to one species for anothe
r . On geologic time scales , climate cycles can result in cyclic vegetation changes by directly alt
ering the physical environment .HistoryThe cyclic model of succession was proposed in 1947 by Britis
h ecologist Alexander Watt , heath , and bog communities , Watt describes the plant community is a r
egenerating entity consisting of a space-time mosaic of species , whose cyclic behavior can be chara
cterized by patch dynamics . Based on the current composition and its corresponding stage of success
ion , he explains , a community can either be in an upgrade phase toward late-successional shrubs or
