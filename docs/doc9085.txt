 .Drug deliveryNanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells usi
ng nanoparticles . The overall drug consumption and side-effects may be lowered significantly by dep
ositing the active agent in the morbid region only and in no higher dose than needed . This highly s
elective approach would found in dendrimers and nanoporous materials . Another example is to use blo
ck co-polymers , which form micelles for drug encapsulation . They could hold small drug molecules t
ransporting them to the desired location . Another vision is based on small electromechanical system
s nanoelectromechanical systems are being investigated for the active release of drugs . Some potent
ially important applications include cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells . Targe
ted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in cons
umption and treatment expenses . The increased efficiency of delivery results in overall societal be
