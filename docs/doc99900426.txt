tan , 2010 )ReferencesIn vibrational spectroscopy , an overtone band is the spectral band that occur
s in a vibrational spectrum of a molecule when the molecule makes a transition from the ground state
 ( v=0 ) to the second excited state ( v=2 ) , where v is the vibrational quantum number that one ge
ts after solving the Schrdinger equation for the molecule under consideration . It takes only non-ne
gative integer values . Generally , in order to study the vibrational spectra of molecules , the vib
ration of the chemical bonds is assumed to be simple harmonic.Thus the parabolic simple harmonic pot
ential is used in the Schrdinger equation to solve for the vibrational energy eigenstates . When the
 Schrdinger equation is solved one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates .
