ason continued where the previous season left off and after 4 games , Town were top of the table wit
h 3 wins , including a 5-1 win over Portsmouth , where Jimmy Glazzard got the first of his 3 hat-tri
cks that he would achieve during the 3 matches against Sheffield United and Aston Villa . The team '
s performances kept them up in the upper realms of the division , with the chance of winning the tit
le , not being too unrealistic . The season ground to a halt near the end , when Vic Metcalfe was fo
rced to miss the last 7 games of the season and many say this was the reason that Town failed to win
 the title for the first time in 28 years . They did however finish 3rd , just 6 points behind Wolve
rhampton Wanderers , who Town actually beat in their penultimate game of the season .Squad at the en
