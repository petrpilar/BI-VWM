ery durable and capable of withstanding very high temperature and currents . The seal and the glass 
must have the same coefficient of expansion . For low electrode wear the electrodes are usually made
 of tungsten , which has the highest melting point of any metal , to handle the thermionic emission 
of electrons . Cathodes are often made from porous tungsten filled with a barium compound , which gi
ves low work function the structure of cathode has to be tailored for the application . Anodes are u
sually made from pure tungsten , or , when good machinability is required , lanthanum-alloyed tungst
en , and are often machined to provide extra surface area to cope with power loading . DC arc lamps 
often have a cathode with from the glass and to control temperature . Flashtubes usually have a cath
ode with a flattened radius , to reduce the incidence of hot spots and decrease sputter caused by pe
ak currents , which may be in excess of 1000 amperes . Electrode design is also influenced by the av
