hePlasmodium falciparumprotein PfEBP-2 ( erythrocyte binding protein 2 baebl EBA-140 ) .HistoryThe a
ntigen was discovered in 1960 when three women who lacked the antigen made anti-Gea in response to p
regnancy . The antigen is named after one of the patients - a Mrs Gerbich . The following year a new
 but related antigen was discovered in a Mrs Yus for whom an antigen in this system is also named . 
In 1972 a numerical system for the antigens in this blood group was introduced .GenomicsDespite the 
similar names glycophorin C and D are unrelated to the other three glycophorins latter proteins are 
closely related . Glycophorin A and glycophorin B carry the blood group MN and Ss antigens respectiv
ely . There are 225,000 molecules of GPC and GPD per erythrocyte . Originally it was thought that gl
ycophorin C and D were the result of a gene duplication event but it was only later realised that th
at they were encoded by the same gene . Glycophorin D ( GPD ) is generated from the glycophorin C me
