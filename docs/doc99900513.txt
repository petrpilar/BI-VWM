Eremitawas the product of an intentional contrast withAfter. He describedAfteras a very desolate , b
leak landscape . There were no signs of life in any of the lyrics , while , forEremita, the atmosphe
re is much more introverted , much more paranoid and kind of schizophrenic . I tend to bring up many
 of the same themes , but lyrically it comes from a different perspective . The album 's sense of in
troversion , paranoia , and schizophrenia is represented in the Nietzsche turned to Nietzsche 's mad
 final years . Nietzsche is represented in the cover , which features an upside-down image of his fa
ce from later in his life , when he was on the verge of insanity . As Ihsahn explained ,Eremitais a 
reflective album thats filtered through the eyes of a madman . He elaborated upon the connection , e
xplaining that There 's an escapism to this album , there 's a paranoia , a lot of issues that are d
ealt with , and these pictures of Nietzsche are from very close to when he tipped over into madness
