device is usually a combination of both analog machine and analog media that can together measure , 
record , or reproduce ( emit ) continuous information , for example , the almost infinite number of 
grades of transparency , voltage , resistance , rotation , or pressure . In theory , the continuous 
information ( also analog signal ) has an infinite number of possible values with the only limitatio
n on resolution being the accuracy of the analog device .Examples Non-electricalThere are notable no
n-electrical analog devices , such as clocks ( sundials , water clocks , pendulum clocks , analog wa
tches ) , the astrolabe , slide rules , the governor of a steam engine , the planimeter ( a simple d
evice that measures the area of a closed shape ) , Kelvin 's mechanical tide predictor , acoustic ra
ngefinders , servomechanisms ( e.g. the thermostat ) , a simple mercury thermometer , a bathroom sca
le , and the speedometer of a car .ElectricalThe telautograph is an analogue precursor to the modern
