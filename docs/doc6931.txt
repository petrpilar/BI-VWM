stances of each wheel . In general the M4 system is not widely used as it is suited toward sports ca
rs and some off-road racing vehicles .BenefitsThe engine is usually where the weight of a car is mos
t concentrated so placing it between the front and rear axles gives a car a much better handling bal
ance . Assuming the engine is behind the passenger compartment , the engine will also be pushing dow
n on the shifted toward the rear under acceleration in all cars as a rule , this further improves th
e amount of grip on the rear wheels , increasing the amount of torque that can be supplied to the re
ar wheels before wheelspin occurs . Because the engine is not in the front , the car can be designed
 with a minimum amount of frontal area perpendicular to the wind , greatly increasing aerodynamic ef
ficiency . A computer-controlled four-wheel-drive differential system allows a car to both accelerat
e and corner more quickly , since it can vary the amount of torque going to the front and rear wheel
