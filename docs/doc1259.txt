lsed-power level increases as the flash duration decreases , the explosion energy must then be decre
ased in direct proportion to the square root of discharge time . Failure from heat is usually caused
 by excessively long pulse durations or high average power levels . When the inner wall of the tube 
gets too hot while the outer wall is still cold , this temperature gradient can cause the lamp to cr
ack . Similarly , if the electrodes heat much faster than the glass , the lamp may crack or even sha
tter at the ends .Gradual failureThe closer a flashtube operates to its explosion energy , the great
er the risk becomes for catastrophic failure . At 50% of the explosion energy , the lamp may produce
 several thousand flashes before exploding . At 60% of the explosion energy , the lamp will usually 
fail in less than a hundred . energy the risk of catastrophic failure becomes very low . The methods
 of failure then become those that reduce the output efficiency and affect the ability to trigger th
