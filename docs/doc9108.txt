at the particle and surrounding tissue . Light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecu
les which will chemically react with and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them ( like
 tumors ) . This therapy is appealing for many reasons . It does not leave a toxic trail of reactive
 molecules throughout the body ( chemotherapy ) because it is directed where only the light is shine
d and the particles exist . Photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for deali

f the inflammatory response and therapeutic siRNA silencing via RGD-nanoparticles in a lung cancer m
ouse model . This study reported the use of siRNA/RGD gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor 
cells in two lung cancer xenograft mouse models , resulting in successful and significantc-Myconcoge
