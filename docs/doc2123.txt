ent sites between the erythrocyte spectrin-actin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer are glycophorin 
C and band 3 . The interaction with band 4.1 and p55 is mediated by the N terminal 30 kD domain of b
and 4.1 binding to a 16 amino acid segment ( residues 82-98 : residues 61-77 of glycophorin D ) with
in the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C and to a positively charged 39 amino acid motif in p55 . 
The majority of protein 4.1 is bound to glycophorin C. The magnitude of the strength of the interact
ion between glycophorin C and band 4.1 has been estimated to be 6.9 microNewtons per meter , a figur
