 two thermodynamic systems A and B are in thermal equilibrium , and B and C are also in thermal equi
librium , then A and C are in thermal equilibrium . First principle of energetics : The increase in 
the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by heating , mi
nus the amount lost in the form of work done by the system on its surroundings . Second principle of
 energetics : The total entropy of any isolated maximum value . Third principle of energetics : As a
 system approaches absolute zero of temperature all processes cease and the entropy of the system ap
proaches a minimum value or zero for the case of a perfect crystalline substance . Fourth principle 
of energetics : There seem to be two opinions on the fourth principle of energetics : : The Onsager 
reciprocal relations are sometimes called the fourth law of thermodynamics . As the fourth law of th
ermodynamics Onsager reciprocal relations would constitute the fourth principle of energetics. : In
