arch for food . The monitor lizards require approximately three to four full ( about 5565 cm excludi
ng their tails ) and at least three hibernation periods before they become sexually mature . The ove
rall lifespan ofV. griseusin the wild does not normally exceed around eight years in both males and 
females .Importance of body temperature V. griseusis a cold-blooded ectotherm whose behaviors theref
ore depend on the outside temperatures . Many lizards become sluggish in cold weather and even may b
ecome inactive if the temperature decreases substantially . Their olfactory and nerve signals signif
icantly slow down , which severely limit the lizard from either catching potential prey or escaping 
from predators . The body temperature ofV. griseusis directly proportional to its running speed betw
een the temperatures of 21 and 37 C. Between those temperatures , the running speed of the monitor l
izard increases from a little over 1 m/s at 21 C to around 3 m/s at 37 C. Over 37 C , its running sp
