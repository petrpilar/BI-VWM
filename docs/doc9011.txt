r 1939 , Latvia was forced to accept a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union , granting the S
oviets the right to station between 25,000 and 30,000 troops on Latvian territory . After staging bo
rder incidents , on 16 June 1940 the government of the USSR handed the Latvian ambassador in Moscow 
a note , in which Latvia was accused of breaching the articles of the agreement of 5 October 1939 , 
and demands were made for sending in additional Soviet troops and to change the government . The Lat
vian government capitulated in the face of overwhelming force . On 17 June Soviet troops invaded Lat
vian territory . In Soviet forces are marching into our land this very morning . This is happening w
ith the knowledge and consent of the government , which in turn stems from the amicable relations th
at exist between Latvia and the Soviet Union . It is , therefore , my wish that the residents of our
 country also show friendship towards the advancing military units .. The government has resigned .
