deasInformal inferential reasoning involved the following related ideas of distributions , signal ( 
a stable component of population/process such as averages ) and noise ( a variable component of popu
lation/process such as the deviations of individual value around an average ) and types of ' noise '
 or variability ( measurement variability , natural variability , sampling variability ) . Sample si
ze. Bigger samples are better because they provide a more accurate estimate of the population/proces
s signals . Controlling for bias. The use of random sampling to be sure not to introduce bias in the
 sampling process and thus increase the chance that the sample we get is representative of the popul
ation Tendency. Distinguish between claims that are always true and that are often or sometimes true
 .Tasks that Involve Informal Inferential ReasoningZieffler et al . ( 2008 ) suggest three types of 
tasks that have been used in studies of students ' informal inferential reasoning and its developmen
