oforms are known and the gene is expressed in a wide variety of tissues including kidney , thymus , 
stomach , breast , adult liver and erythrocyte . In the non erythroid cell lines , expression is low
er than in the erythrocyte and the protein is differentially glycosylated . In the erythrocyte glyco
phorin C makes up 4% of the membrane sialoglycoproteins . The average number of O linked chains is 1
2 per molecule . The gene is expressed early in the development of the erythrocyte , specifically in
 the erythroid burst-forming unit and erythroid colony-forming unit . The mRNA from human erythrobla
sts is 1.4 kilobases long mapped to 1050 base pairs 5 ' of the start codon . It is expressed early i
n developlment and before the Kell antigens , Rhesus-associated glycoprotein , glycophorin A , band 
3 , the Rhesus antigen and glycophorin B. In melanocytic cells Glycophorin C gene expression may be 
regulated by MITF . GPC appears to be synthesized in excess in the erythrocyte and that the membrane
