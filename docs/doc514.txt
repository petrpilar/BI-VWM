alkylbenzenesulfonates , a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard
 water , because the polar sulfonate ( of detergents ) is less likely than the polar carboxyl ( of s
oap ) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water . In most household contexts , the termd
etergentby itself refers specifically tolaundry detergentordish detergent, as opposed tohand soapor 
other types of cleaning agents . Detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated soluti
ons . Detergents , like soaps , work because they are amphiphilic : partly hydrophilic ( polar ) and
 partly hydrophobic ( non-polar ) . Their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compoun
ds ( like oil and grease ) with water . Because air is not hydrophilic , detergents are also foaming
 agents to varying degrees .Chemical classification of depending on the electrical charge of the sur
factants.Anionic detergentsTypical anionic detergents are alkylbenzenesulfonates . The alkylbenzene
