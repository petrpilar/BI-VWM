rbelled arch ) is an arch-like construction method that uses the architectural technique of corbelin
g to span a space or void in a structure , such as an entranceway in a wall or as the span of a brid
ge . A corbel vault uses this technique to support the superstructure of a building 's roof . A corb
el arch is constructed by offsetting successive courses of stone ( or brick ) at the springline of t
he walls so that they project towards the archway 's center from each supporting side , until the co
urses meet at the apex of the archway ( often , the last gap is bridged with a flat stone ) . For a 
corbeled vault covering the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two oppos
ing walls . Although an improvement in load-bearing efficiency over the post and lintel design , cor
beled arches are not entirely self-supporting structures , and the corbeled arch is sometimes termed
 a false arch for this reason . Unlike true arches , not all of the structure 's tensile into compre
