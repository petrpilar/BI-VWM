d At completion , the reaction produces a molar heat of reactionH r which is shown as a measurable t
emperature changeT. In an ideal system , where no losses or gains of heat due to environmental influ
ences are involved , the progress of the reaction is observed as whetherH r is negative ( indicating
 an exothermic reaction ) or positive ( indicating an endothermic reaction ) . In this context , env
ironmental influences may include : Heat losses or gains from outside the system via the vessel wall
