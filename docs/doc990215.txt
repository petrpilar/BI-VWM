 &amplambda can have dimension 1 , in which case any orthonormal basis forV &amplambda would lead to
 the desired result . Write the triangular matrixUasU=D+N, whereDis diagonal andNis strictly upper t
riangular ( and thus a nilpotent matrix ) . The diagonal matrixDcontains the eigenvalues ofAin arbit
rary order ( hence its Frobenius norm , squared , isA, while the Frobenius norm ofA, squared , is th
e sum of the squared singular values ofA) . The nilpotent partNis generally not unique either , but 
its Frobenius norm is uniquely determined byA( just because the Frobenius norm of A is equal to the 
Frobenius norm ofU=D+N) . It is clear that ifAis a normal matrix , thenUfrom its Schur decomposition
 must be a diagonal matrix and the column vectors ofQare the eigenvectors ofA. Therefore , the Schur
 decomposition extends the spectral decomposition . In particular , ifAis positive definite , the Sc
hur decomposition ofA, its spectral decomposition , and its singular value decomposition coincide .
