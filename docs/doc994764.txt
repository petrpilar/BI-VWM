ction is partly or completely blocked . It is often necessary to keep a number of electrodes cycling
 through a rejuvenation program in order to keep up with an analytical workload . Thermometric senso
rs have no electrochemical interaction with the titrating solution , and therefore can be used on a 
continuous basis with essentially no maintenance . Similarly , the potentiometric titration of sulfa
te with barium chloride in various industrial samples can lead to rapid degradation of the indicatin
