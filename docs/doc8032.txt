 of Norton is revealed to have had a population of 301 with an additional 74 living in an exclave of
 the parish at Bilston . A late protein is a viral protein that is formed after replication of the v
irus . One example is VP4 from simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) . In Human papillomavirus , two late protein
s are involved in capsid formation : a major ( L1 ) and a minor ( L2 ) protein , in the approximate 
proportion 95:5% . L1 forms a pentameric assembly unit of the viral shell in a manner that closely r
esembles VP1 from polyomaviruses . Intermolecular disulphide bonding holds the L1 capsid proteins to
gether . L1 capsid proteins can bind via its nuclear localisation signal ( NLS ) to karyopherins Kap
beta(2) and Kapbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the 
productive phase of the viral life cycle . Surface loops on L1 pentamers contain sites of sequence v
ariation between HPV types . L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection : in
