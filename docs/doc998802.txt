ecies . There are notable exceptions , such as the Cp 3 Ce(III) complex shown at right , but they ar
e relatively rare . Complexes involving cerium of various oxidation states are known : though lantha
nides are most stable in the +3 state , complexes of cerium(IV) have been reported . These latter co
mpounds have found less widespread use due to their oxidizing nature , and the majority of literatur
e regarding organometallic cerium complexes involves the +3 oxidation state . In particular , organo
cerium compounds have been developed extensively as non-basic carbon nucleophiles in organic synthes
is . Because cerium is relatively non-toxic , they serve as an environmentally friendly alternative 
to other organometallic reagents . Several reviews detailing these applications have been published 
.StructureThe solution structure of organocerium reagents heavily on the manner in which it is prepa
red . In particular , those derived from organolithium reagents likely are believed to form somethin
