r images , showed a network of branching valleys in Thaumasia called Warrego Valles . These networks
 are evidence that Mars may have once been warmer , wetter , and perhaps had precipitation in the fo
rm of rain or snow . A study with the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter , Thermal Emission Imaging System
 ( THEMIS ) and the Mars Orbiter Camera ( MOC ) support the idea that Warrego Valles was formed from
 precitation . At first glance they resemble river valleys on our Earth . But sharper images from mo
re advanced cameras reveal that the valleys are not continuous . They are very old and may have suff
ered from the effects of erosion . A picture below shows some of near Warrego Valles , as seen by TH
EMIS . These branched channels are strong evidence for flowing water on Mars , perhaps during a much
 warmer period . Other views from Thaumasia Image:Thaumasia Map.JPGMap of Thaumasia quadrangle with
