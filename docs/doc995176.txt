. All commercial ADN products currently support HTTP compression . A second compression technique is
 achieved through data reduction algorithms . Because these algorithms are proprietary and modify th
e application traffic , they are symmetric and require a device to reassemble the application traffi
c before the client can receive it . A separate class provide this functionality , but the technolog
y has been slowly added to the ADN portfolio over the past few years as this class of device continu
es to become more application aware , providing additional features for specific applications such a

hecking is the ability of an ADN to determine not only the state of the server on which an applicati
