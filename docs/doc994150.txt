unch occurred after Longley and Staubach had fought over a negative remark Longley made about Stauba
ch to fellow Cowboy teammates . Staubach was putting on his shoulder pads on the last day of trainin
g camp when Longley hit him in the face without warning and from behind , requiring several stitches
 to close the wound on Staubach 's face . Longley was immediately traded to the San Diego Chargers w
here he finished his career with little more success . Apparently , there is more mouthing off about
 teammates , but Gil Brandt said the tiff between Staubach and Longley began with a simple game of b
oredom . ' Roger always could bounce the football off the ground to come right back to him , ' Brand
t said . ' He 'd do it over and over . They 'd have contests , and Clint could n't do it . ' Longley
 challenged Roger to a fight . Roger told him they were going to meet on another field after practic
e . ' Staubach and Longley took off their helmets and pads . ' They got after it , ' Brandt said . '
