mostly for photographic purposes but are also employed in scientific , medical and industrial applic
ations .ConstructionThe lamp comprises a hermetically sealed glass tube , which is filled with a nob
le gas , usually xenon , and electrodes to carry electrical current to the gas . Additionally , a hi
gh voltage power source is necessary to energize the gas . A charged capacitor is usually used for t
his purpose , so as to allow very speedy delivery of very high electrical current when the lamp is t
riggered .Glass envelopesThe glass envelope is most commonly a thin tube , often made of fused quart
z , borosilicate or Pyrex , which may be straight including helical , U shape , and circular ( to su
rround a camera lens for shadowless photography'ring flashes ' ) . In some applications , the emissi
on of ultraviolet light is undesired , whether due to production of ozone , damage to laser rods , d
egradation of plastics , or other detrimental effects . In these cases , a doped fused silica is use
