Part of the back labial corner is missing . The lingual row contains three cusps and the labial prob
ably five ( the broken corner renders the number uncertain ) . Transverse ridges , separated by deep
 valleys , connect the lingual and labial cusps therefore , the cusps are not strongly separate , bu
t rather fused . The lingual cusps are larger and separated by larger valleys than the labial ones .
 At the front of the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first t
wo labial cusps . A low crest connects the first lingual to the first labial cusp and relatively sha
llow valley , connects the second lingual to the first labial cusp . Behind this structure , a secon
d triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the labial s
ide ( the back of the two is broken away , but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern ) . 
The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove . The third lingual cusp is also connected
