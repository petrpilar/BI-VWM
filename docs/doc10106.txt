 depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci 'sThe Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus co
uld have sweated blood at Gethsemane . Leaving the Middle East for the first time , he travels to Ne
w York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe , a forensic pathologist at Columbia University . Zugibe
 states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis , a medical condition brought about by 
stress from knowing that one is about to die . He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sai
lors and in men given death sentences . Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County , Vermont
 , by measuring their blood pressure while level with their shoulders . He concludes that the tradit
ional view of Jesus 's crucifixion , with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather tha
n wrists , may have been possible if his feet were supported . The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of
 Jehohanan , a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion , also supports this theory . 3
