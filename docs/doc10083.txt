ion to continue . The Deep Space series was continued by the Deep Space 2 probes , which were launch
ed in January 1999 on Mars Polar Lander and were intended to strike the surface of Mars . Deep Space
 1 was the first spacecraft to use Ion powered rocketry , in contrast to the traditional chemical po
wered rockets .Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment ( 2002 )The Gravity Recovery And Climate Expe
riment ( GRACE ) , a joint mission of NASA and the German Aerospace Center , has been making detaile
d measurements of Earth 's gravity field since its launch in March 2002 . The satellites were launch
ed from Plesetsk Cosmodrome , Russia on a Rockot ( SS-19 + Breeze upper stage ) launch vehicle . By 
measuring gravity , GRACE shows how mass is distributed around the planet and how it varies over tim
e . Data from the GRACE satellites is an important tool for studying Earth 's ocean , geology , and 
climate . GRACE is a collaborative endeavor involving the Austin NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ,
