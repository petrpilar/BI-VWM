served such invariance , such a principle is usually then given the status of a ' fundamental law ' 
of science . Like in all science , whether or not a theorem or principle is considered a to such a p
roposition . The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental laws . Philo
sophers of science have held that the fundamental laws of thermodynamics can be treated as the laws 
of energetics , ( Reiser 1926 , p. 432 ) . Through the clarification of these laws energetics aims t

 with the work of Leibniz . Liet. -Col . Richard de Villamil ( 1928 ) said that Rankine formulated t
