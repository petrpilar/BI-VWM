ide a global map of the reflecting layers . Links were found to the 11 year sunspot cycle and the Au
rora Borealis , the magnetic storms that occur in high latitudes . This became particularly relevant
 during the second world war when the storms would lead to radio blackouts . Thanks to Appletons res
earch , the periods when these would occur could be predicted and communication could be switched to
 wavelengths that would be least affected . RADAR , another crucial wartime innovation , was one tha
t came about thanks to Appletons work . On a very general level , his research consisted in determin
ing the distance of reflecting objects from radio signal transmitters . This is exactly the idea of 
RADAR and the flashing dots that appear on the screen ( a cathode ray tube ) scanned by by Appleton 
as a new method , called the pulse method , to make ionospheric measurements . It was later adapted 
by Robert Watson-Watt to detect aeroplanes . Nowadays , ionospheric data is important when communica
