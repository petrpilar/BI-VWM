ugh its is a sphere , a good choice of coordinates would be : : lbrace q1 , q2 rbrace = lbrace theta
 , phi rbrace , where and are the angle coordinates familiar from spherical coordinates . Thercoordi
nate has been effectively dropped , as a particle moving on a sphere maintains a constant radius . -
-Generalized velocities and kinetic energyEach generalized coordinate qi is associated with a genera
lized velocity dot qi , defined as : : dot qi=dqi over dt The kinetic energy of a particle is : T = 
frac m2 left ( dot x2 + dot y2 + dot z2 right ) . In more general terms , for a system of p particle
s with n degrees of freedom , this may be written : T =sumi=1 p frac mi2 left ( dot xi2 + dot yi2 + 
dot zi2 right ) . If the transformation equations between the Cartesian and generalized coordinates 
: xi = xi left ( q1 , q2 , yi = yi left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn , t right ) : zi = zi left ( q1 , q2 , 
... , qn , t right ) are known , then these equations may be differentiated to provide the time-deri
