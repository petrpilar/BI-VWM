of effects for general factorials . They also developed statistical tools in 2008 to calculate power
 for a broad range of experimental designs and precision as a power substitute via fraction of desig
n space ( FDS ) for response surface methods ( RSM ) and mixture design . Whitcomb and Anderson have
 written two non-academic books on DOE the books include a free educational version of Stat-Ease sof
