t , there is no widely agreed approach to the structuring of such specifications . This adds to the 
cost of adopting the use of UML for system specification , hampers communication between system deve
lopers and makes it difficult to relate or merge system specifications where there is a need to inte
grate IT systems . Although the ODP reference model provides abstract languages for the relevant con
cepts , it does not prescribe particular notations to be used in the individual viewpoints . The vie
wpoint languages defined in the reference model are abstract languages in the sense that they define
 what concepts should be used , not how they should be represented . This lack of precise notations 
for expressing the different models involved in a multi-viewpoint specification of a system is a com
