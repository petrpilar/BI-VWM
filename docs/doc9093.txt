osomes also help to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug doe
s to the heart muscles specifically . In a mice study , scientists from Rice University and Universi
ty of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reported enhanced effectiveness and reduced toxicity of an exi
sting treatment for head and neck cancer when using the nanoparticles to deliver the drug . The hydr
ophilic carbonic clusters functionalized with polyethylene glycol or PEG-HCC are mixed with the chem
otherapeutic receptor ( EGFR ) targeted Cetuximab and injected intravenously . They found the tumors
 were killed more effectively with radiation and the healthy tissue suffered less toxicity than with
out the nanotechnology drug delivery . The standard treatment contains Cremophor EL which allows the
 hydrophobic paclitaxel to be delivered intravenously . Replacing the toxic Cremophor with carbon na
noparticles eliminated its side effect and improved drug targeting which in turn required a lower do
