s than 2 hours . Reagents derived from alkyl , alkynyl , and alkenyl organometallic reagents as well
 as cerium enolates have been described . The stability of each is approximately the same regardless
 of origin ( i.e. lithiate or Grignard ) , with the exception of alkenyl reagents , which tend to be
 more stable when derived from the corresponding lithiate . The reasons for this are still poorly un
derstood . Functional groups compatible with the parent organometallic compound are generally also s
table upon transmetallation to cerium . The figure below summarizes the kinds of organocerium compou
nds that have been prepared , highlighting several of the more ' exotic ' species reported in the li
terature .ReactionsOrganocerium reagents are used almost exclusively for addition reactions in the s
ame vein as organolithium and Grignard reagents . To this end , they have a number of particularly u
seful characteristics that distinguish them from their more common counterparts . They are incredibl
