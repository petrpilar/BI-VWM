al icebergs have too small a surface above water for an airstrip , and are prone to suddenly rolling
 over . The project would have been abandoned , except for the invention of pykrete , a mixture of w
ater and woodpulp which frozen together was stronger than plain ice , was slower melting , and of co
urse would not sink . It has been suggested that Pyke was inspired by Inuit sleds reinforced with mo
ss . This is probably apocryphal , as the material was originally described in a paper by Mark and H
ohenstein in Brooklyn , NY . Pykrete could be machined like wood and cast into shapes like metal , a
nd when immersed in water formed an insulating shell of wet wood pulp on its surface Perutz found a 
problem : ice slowly flows , in what is known as plastic flow , and his tests showed that a pykrete 
ship would slowly sag unless it was cooled to -16 C. To accomplish this , the ship 's surface would 
have to be protected by insulation and it would need a refrigeration plant and a complicated system
