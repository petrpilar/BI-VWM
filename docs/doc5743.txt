niques where endpoints can be located accurately and precisely without a subjective interpretation o
n the part of the analyst as to their location . Enthalpy change is arguably the most fundamental an
d universal property of chemical reactions , so the observation of temperature change is a natural c
hoice in monitoring their progress . It is not a new technique , with possibly the first recognizabl
e thermometric titration method reported early in the 20th century ( Bell and Cowell , 1913 ) . In s
pite of its attractive features , and in spite of the considerable research that has been conducted 
in the field and a large body of applications that have been developed it has been until now an unde
r-utilized technique in the critical area of industrial process and quality control . Automated pote
ntiometric titration systems have pre-dominated in this area since the 1970s . With the advent of ch
eap computers able to handle the powerful thermometric titration software , development has now reac
