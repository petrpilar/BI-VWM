by adding a large excess ( flooding ) all but one of the reactants .CatalysisThe study of catalysis 
and catalytic reactions is very important to the field of physical organic chemistry . A catalyst pa
rticipates in the chemical reaction but is not consumed in the process . A catalyst lowers the activ
ation energy barrier ( G either stabilizing the transition state structure or destabilizing a key re
action intermediate , and as only a small amount of catalyst is required it can provide economic acc
ess to otherwise expensive or difficult to synthesize organic molecules . Catalysts may also influen
ce a reaction rate by changing the mechanism of the reaction .Kinetic isotope effectAlthough a rate 
law provides the stoichiometry of the transition state structure , it does not provide any informati
on about breaking or forming bonds . The substitution of an isotope near a reactive position often l
eads to a change in the rate of a reaction . Isotopic substitution changes the potential energy of r
