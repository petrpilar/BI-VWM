 , i=1 , 2 that arise from the two constraint equations .CoordinatesNow introduce the generalized co
ordinates i i=1,2 that define the angular position of each mass of the double pendulum from the vert
ical direction . In this case , we have : mathbfr1 = ( L1sintheta1 , -L1costheta1 ) , quad mathbfr2 
-L2costheta2 ) . The force of gravity acting on the masses is given by , : mathbfF1= ( 0 , -m1 g ) ,
 quad mathbfF2= ( 0 , -m2 g ) where g is the acceleration of gravity . Therefore , the virtual work 
of gravity on the two masses as they follow the trajectories r i , i=1,2 is given by : delta W = mat
hbfF1cdotdelta mathbfr1 + mathbfF2cdotdelta mathbfr2 . The variations r i i=1 , 2 can be computed to
 be : delta mathbfr1 = ( L1costheta1 , L1sintheta1 ) deltatheta1 , quad delta mathbfr2 = ( L1costhet
a1 , L1sintheta1 ) deltatheta1 + ( L2costheta2 , L2sintheta2 ) deltatheta2 Virtual workThus , the vi
rtual work is given by : delta W = 31943TOOLONG - 25976TOOLONG , and the generalized forces are : Ft
