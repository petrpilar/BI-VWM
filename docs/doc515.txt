portion of these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic . Two different varieties hav
e been popularized , those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups . The forme
r were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable .
 An estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets .
 Bile acids , such as deoxycholic acid ( DOC ) , are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid
 in digestion and absorption of fats and oils .Cationic detergentsCationic detergents are similar to
 the anionic ones , with a hydrophobic component , but , instead of the anionic sulfonate group , th
e cationic surfactants have quaternary ammonium as the polar end . The ammonium center is positively
 charged .Non-ionic and zwitterionic detergentsNon-ionic detergents are characterized by their uncha
rged , hydrophilic headgroups . Typical non-ionic detergents are based on polyoxyethylene or a glyco
