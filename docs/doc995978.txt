ers such as the relationship to the site of origin and intensity of the signal can then be put toget
her to form images of what lies inside the target tissues . Higher frequency ultrasound waves genera
lly produce higher resolution images , but attenuation also increases as frequency increases which r
estricts imaging depth . Consequently , the best frequency has been determined for each type of diag
nostic test and body tissue . Some of the more and Doppler techniques . These test produce images ra

iagnostic field due to its non-invasive characteristic . Medical professionals can now observe tissu
es within the body without having to physically enter the body . This reduces the amount of invasive
 and risky diagnostic procedures and increases the chances of a correct diagnosis . Some common medi
