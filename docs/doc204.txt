d the cost function to be minimized , that can be any function of the data scriptstyle x and the net
work 's output , scriptstyle f . The cost function is dependent on the task ( ' a prioriassumptions 
( the implicit properties of our model , its parameters and the observed variables ) . As a trivial 
example , consider the model scriptstyle f(x) = a where scriptstyle a is a constant and the cost scr
iptstyle C=E ( x - f(x)2 . Minimizing this cost will give us a value of scriptstyle a that is equal 
to the mean of the data . The cost function can be much more complicated . Its form depends on the a
pplication : for example , in compression it could be related to the mutual information between scri
ptstyle x and scriptstyle f(x) , whereas in statistical modeling , it could be related to the poster
ior probability of the model given the data . ( Note that in both of those examples those quantities
