idge , Tennessee , and Paducah , Kentucky. , The long-term storage of DUF 6 presents environmental ,
 health , and safety risks because of its chemical instability . When UF 6 is exposed to moist air ,
 it reacts with the water in the air and produces UO 2 F 2 ( uranyl fluoride ) and HF ( hydrogen flu
oride ) , cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks . The estimated lif
etime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades . There have been several accidents involving ur
anium hexafluoride in the United States . The vulnerability of DUF 6 storage cylinders to terrorist 
attack is apparently not the subject of public reports . However , the U.S. government has been conv
erting DUF 6 to solid uranium oxides for disposal . Disposing of the whole DUF 6 inventory could cos
t anywhere from 15 to 450 million dollars . In the 1980s the telecommunications industry expected th
