e Lockheed Model 10 Electra , the Lockheed 12 was not popular as an airliner but was widely used as 
a corporate and government transport . Several were also used for testing new aviation technologies 
.Design and developmentAfter Lockheed had introduced its 10-passenger Model 10 Electra , the company
 decided to develop a smaller version which would be better suited as a feeder airliner or a corpora
te executive transport . At the same time , the U.S. Bureau of Air Commerce had also sensed the need
 for a small feeder airliner and announced a design competition for one . In order for a candidate t
o qualify for the competition , a prototype had to fly by June 30 , 1936 . Lockheed based its candid
ate , which it named the version of the Electra airframe . It would carry only six passengers and tw
o pilots but would use the same 450 hp Pratt &amp Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior SB radial engines as the
 main Electra version , the 10A . This made it faster than the Electra , with a top speed of 225 mph
