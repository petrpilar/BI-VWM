her A or B. This configuration results in a cyclic scheme of species dominance .MechanismsCyclic suc
cession is a descriptive phenomenon that can be accounted for in several ways . In Watts bog system 
, he suggested that factors endogenous to the plant species were at play . He writes , Each patch in
 this space-time mosaic is dependent on its neighbours and develops under conditions partly imposed 
by them . In other words , species life history characteristics fluctuate cyclically under the influ
ence of surrounding species . These periodic shifts in life history properties produce observable ch
anges in community composition . In the system Watt observed , phasic development was specifically r
esponsible for changes in growth and mortality rate . As a result of changes in survival and growth 
ability , the balance of species dominance shifts , relationships satisfies the conditions described
 in the model above , a cyclic pattern of succession is observed . Exogenous factors , such as depre
