 the base the stage then many more sections would be likely candidates for the GSSP , e.g. in Austra
lia , Kazakhstan and Canada . Candidates for the biostratigraphic marker are the first appearance of
 a trilobite or conodont species . The trilobiteLotagnostus americanuswas first suggested by the ICS
 , but has proven to be problematic . In 2006 another working group proposed the first appearance of
Cordylodus andresi. Currently the first appearance ofEoconodontus notchpeakensisis favored by many a
uthors because it is globally widespread and is independent of facies ( known from continental rise 
to peritidal environments ) . TheEoconodontus notchpeakensisproposal would also incorporate a non-bi
ostratigraphic marker to correlate the beginning of Stage 10 globally . A carbon isotope excursion (
 the HERB-event ) occurs in the lower part of theE. notchpeakensisrange .SubdivisionsCambrian Stage 
10 can be subdivided using different biostratigraphic zones . Several conodont zone and trilobites.R
