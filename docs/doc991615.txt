ace ShuttleIndependence, formerlyExplorera mockup in Houston , TXReferencesRecombinant DNA ( rDNA ) 
molecules are DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods of genetic recombination ( such as molecula
r cloning ) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources , creating sequences that would
 not otherwise be found in biological organisms . Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA molecules 
from all organisms share the same chemical structure . They differ only in the nucleotide sequence w
ithin that identical overall structure .IntroductionRecombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called c
himeric DNA , because they are usually made of material from two different species , like the mythic
al chimera . R-DNA technology uses palindromic sequences and leads to the production of sticky and b
lunt ends . The DNA sequences used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules can originate fr
om any species . For example , plant DNA may be joined to bacterial DNA , or human DNA may be joined
