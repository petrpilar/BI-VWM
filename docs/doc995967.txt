 chemical reaction : 33226067TOOLONG + H 2 O rightleftharpoons 2-oxobutanoate + NH 3 Thus , the two 
substrates of this enzyme are 33226102TOOLONG and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-oxobutanoat
e and NH 3 . This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds
 other than peptide bonds , specifically in compounds that have not been otherwise categorized withi
n EC number 3.5 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 33226137TOOLONG aminohydrolase ( isome
rizing ) . This enzyme is also called 33226172TOOLONG endolyase ( deaminating ) . This enzyme partic
ipates in propanoate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate.Structural studiesAs
 of late 2007 , 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes , with PDB accession codes ,
