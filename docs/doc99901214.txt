tries to generate while walking . Assistive exoskeletons produce some of the torque needed to move o
ne or more leg joints while walking , which allows a healthy individual to generate less muscle torq
ue in those joints and use less metabolic energy . The muscle torque is reduced enough to keep the w
alking without an exoskeleton . The net torque about each joint is the muscular torque plus the actu
ator torque . Disabled individuals do not see much of a decrease , if any , in muscular torque while
 walking with an exoskeleton because their muscles are not strong enough to walk with a normal gait 
, or at all the exoskeleton provides the remaining torque needed for them to walk .Examples Vanderbi
