hole , these systems use algorithms in their programming to determine control and organization of th
eir functions . Most systems use weights to change the parameters of the throughput and the varying 
connections to the neurons . Artificial neural networks can be autonomous and learn by input from ou

erThe multi-layer perceptron ( MLP ) is a universal function approximator , as proven by the Cybenko
 theorem . However , the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the s
ettings of the weights . Work by Hava Siegelmann and Eduardo D. Sontag has provided a proof that a s
