 or severe mechanical stress is anticipated . The thermistor is supported by suitable electronic cir
cuitry to maximize sensitivity to minute changes in solution temperature . The circuitry in the Metr
ohm 859 Titrotherm thermometric titration interface moldule is capable of resolving temperature chan
ges as low as 10 5 K. A critical element in modern automated thermometric titrimetry is the ability 
to locate the endpoint with a high degree of reproducibility . It is clearly impractical and insuffi
cient for modern demands of accuracy and precision to estimate the inflection by intersection of tan
gents . This is done conveniently by derivatization of the temperature curve . The second derivative
 essentially locates the intersection of tangents to the temperature curve immediately pre- and post
- the breakpoint . Thermistors respond quickly to small changes in temperature such as temperature g
radients in the mixed titration solution , and thus the signal can exhibit a small amount of noise .
