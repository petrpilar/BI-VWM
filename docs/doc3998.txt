led energy economics ) is the study of energy under transformation . Because energy flows at all sca
les , from the quantum level to the biosphere and cosmos , energetics is a very broad discipline , e
ncompassing for example thermodynamics , chemistry , biological energetics , biochemistry and ecolog
ical energetics . Where each branch of energetics begins and ends is a topic of constant debate . Fo
r example , Lehninger ( 1973 , p. 21 ) contended that when the science of thermodynamics deals with 
energy exchanges of all types , it can be called energetics.AimsIn general , energetics is concerned
 with seeking principles that accurately describe the useful and non-useful tendencies of energy flo
ws and storages under transformation . ' Principles ' are understood here as phenomena which behave 
like historical invariants under multiple observations . When some critical number of people have ob
