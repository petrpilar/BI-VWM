lensee in Grunewald for the photographing of nebulae . At the end of the 19th. century , the rapid g
rowth of Berlin led to the fact that the Observatory which was once on the edge of the city was now 
fully surrounded by buildings and therefore it became no longer possible to engage in the middle of 
the 1890s therefore Wilhelm Foerster and others proposed the building of a new observatory outside o
f the metropolitan area . In 1904 Hermann von Struve took over from Foersters as the director of the
 observatory . Under his leadership research was considerably extended and the project of yet anothe
r move took on concrete form . After test observations in the surrounding area starting from June 19
06 by Paul Guthnick , who had been active at the observatory as Observator since 1906 following on f
rom his training as an assistant at the observatory from 1901 to 1903 , the decision made by the Kul
tusministeriums fell in favor of his recommended location in the Schlosspark Babelsberg in Potsdam .
