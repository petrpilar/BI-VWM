idarumnaturally infects only members of the family Muridae ( includes both mice and hamsters , Alder
ton , 1996 ) . Two strains ofChlamydia muridarum, MoPn ( originally named Nigg ) and SFPD , have bee
n isolated from mice and hamsters . Glycogen production by both strains has been demonstrated . The 
chromosome and extrachromosomal plasmid of MoPn have been sequenced .Chlamydia muridarumMoPn binds m
Abs recognizingChlamydia trachomatisMOMP vs4 core epitope ( T ) LNPT(IA) . DNA sequence analysis ind
icates that these mAbs should recognize SFPD and thatChlamydia trachomatisB-serogroup mAbs specific 
for the vs4 epitope IAGAG should recognize SFPD . MoPn was isolated in 1942 from the lungs of asympt
omatic albino Swiss mice and was subsequently shown to be capable of producing disease concurrent wi
th a causative agent of proliferative ileitis . MoPn has been shown to be sensitive to sulfadiazine.
