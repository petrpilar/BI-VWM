d in vitro resulting from EB differentiation .Parallels with embryonic developmentMuch of the resear
ch central to embryonic stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis is derived from studies in devel
opmental biology and mammalian embryogenesis . For example , immediately after the blastocyst stage 
of development ( from which ESCs are derived ) , the embryo undergoes gastrulation , whereby cell sp
ecification of the inner cell mass results in the formation of the visceral endoderm and epiblast . 
As the anterior-posterior axis is formed , the embryo develops a transient structure known as the pr
imitive streak . Much of the spatial patterning that occurs during the formation and migration of th
e primitive streak results from the secretion of agonists and antagonists by various cell population
s , including the growth factors from the Wnt and transforming growth factor ( TGF ) families ( Left
y 1 , Nodal ) , as well as repressors of the same molecules ( Dkk-1 , Sfrp1 , Sfrp5 ) . Due to the s
