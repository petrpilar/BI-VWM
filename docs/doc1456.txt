completed over 43 missions . In analytical mechanics , specifically the study of the rigid body dyna
mics of multibody systems , the term generalized coordinates refers to the parameters that describe 
the configuration of the system relative to some reference configuration . These parameters must uni
quely define the configuration of the system relative to the reference configuration . The generaliz
ed velocities are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates of the system . An example of
