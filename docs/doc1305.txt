. This led him to believe that it was possible that two radio signals were being received . One was 
travelling along the ground , and another was reflected by a layer in the upper atmosphere . The fad
ing or variation in strength of the overall radio signal received resulted from the a reflecting atm
ospheric layer was not in itself a completely new idea . Balfour Stewart had suggested the idea in t
he late nineteenth century to explain rhythmic changes in the earths magnetic field . More recently 
, in 1902 , Oliver Heaviside and A. E. Kennelly had suggested such a hypothesis may explain the succ
ess Marconi had in transmitting his signals across the Atlantic . Calculations had shown that natura
l bending of the radio waves was not sufficient to stop them from simply shooting off into empty spa
ce before they reached the receiver . Appleton thought the best place to look for evidence of the io
nosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions .
