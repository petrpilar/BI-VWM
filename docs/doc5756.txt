r does not interact electrically or electrochemically with the solution , electrical conductance of 
the titrating medium is not a pre-requisite for a determination . Titrations may be carried out in c
ompletely non-conducting , non-polar media if required . Further , titrations may be carried out in 
turbid solutions or even suspensions of solids , and titrations where precipitates are reaction prod
ucts can be contemplated . The range of possible thermometric titration applications far exceeds the
 actual experience of this writer , and the reader will be referred to the appropriate literature in
 some instances .Acid-base titrationsDetermination of fully dissociated acids and bases . The heat o
f neutralization of a fully dissociated acid with a fully dissociated base is approximately 56kJ/mol
 . The reaction is thus strongly exothermic , and is an excellent basis for a wide range of analysis
 in industry . An advantage for the industrial analyst is that the use of stronger titrants ( 1 to 2
