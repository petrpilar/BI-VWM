ed turbochargingA sequential turbo can also refer to a system where the output pressure must be grea
ter than can be provided by a single turbo , commonly called a staged twin turbo system . In this ca
se , multiple similarly sized turbochargers are used in sequence , but both operate constantly . The
 first turbo boosts pressure as much as possible ( for example to three times the intake pressure ) 
. Subsequent turbos take the charge from the previous stage and compresses it further ( for example 
to an additional three times intake pressure , for a total boost of nine times atmospheric pressure 
) . This configuration is commonly found on piston engine lower engine speed ( and thus where turbo 
lag is not a primary design consideration ) , and where the intake pressure is quite low due to low 
atmospheric pressure at altitude , requiring a very high pressure ratio . High-performance diesel en
