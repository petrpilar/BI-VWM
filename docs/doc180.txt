ation cost and predictable characterisation , so the formulation chemists prefer this . However , in
 the patient 's body this very stability ( slow degradation ) is a negative factor . Phospholipids o
n the other hand are membrane lipids ( already present in the body and surrounding each cell ) , hav
e a GRAS ( Generally Recognised As Safe ) status from FDA and are derived from natural sources witho
ut any complex chemistry involved . They are not metabolised but rather absorbed by the body and the
 degradation products are themselves nutrients ( fats or micronutrients ) . It is greatly observed t
hat nanoparticles are promising tools for the advancement of drug delivery , medical imaging , and a
s diagnostic sensors . However , the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due t
o the complex host 's reactions to nano- and microsized materials 14 and the difficulty in targeting
 specific organs in the body . Nevertheless , a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better
