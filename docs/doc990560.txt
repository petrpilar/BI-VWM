ore conventional modem technology was chosen and standardized as V.34 . Telebit deemed full-duplex P
EP to require more engineering effort than was justified introduced this feature .The Octocom merger
 and the FastBlazer V.34 modemThe CCITT moved quickly to improve on V.32bis , and by 1993 it was cle
ar that the ratification process for their new 28,800 bit/s V.34 standard was going to be finalized 
in 1994 . Companies lined up to start production of new V.34 designs , some going so far to introduc
