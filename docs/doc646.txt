part of the slate valley of the Upper Taconic Mountains (Taghkanic ,meaning ' in the trees ' ) , and
 part of the Great Appalachian Valley ( also known simply as the ' Great Valley ' ) . Thus , many of
 the main hills , valleys , creeks and roads run diagonally across Hebron in keeping with the genera
l outlay of the Appalachians . Hebron is notably at once a nexus between valley regions within the '
 Great Valley ' , and also between mountain regions . The nexus of the Champlain and Hudson Valleys 
( described in greater detail below in the paragraph on watersheds ) is located here . The taller pe
aks of the Taconics are on the Vermont side of the border , and begin to dwindle comparatively into 
foothills in Hebron . Hebron can be described as the foothills between the Adirondack Mountains of N
ew York , and the Taconic and Green Mountains of Vermont . Hebron thus is a lowlands dividing mounta
in areas . In an era of much water pollution , it is a good thing to be at the top end of watersheds
