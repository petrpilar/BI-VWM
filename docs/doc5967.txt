kground is a scheduling algorithm that is used to control execution of multiple processes on a singl
e processor . It is based on two waiting lists , the first one is called foreground because this is 
the one in which all processes initially enter , and the second one is called background because all
 processes , after using all of their execution time in foreground , are moved to background . When 
a process becomes ready it begins its execution in foreground immediately , forcing the processor to
 give up execution of current process in the background and execute newly created process for a pred
efined period . This period is usually 2 or more quanta . If the process is not finished after its e
xecution in the foreground it is moved to background waiting list where it will be executed only whe
n the foreground list is empty . After being moved to background , process is then run longer than b
efore , usually 4 quanta . The time of execution is increased because the process obviously needs mo
