metry of atoms is 1.8 angstrom but the combined van der Waals radii of hydrogen are 2.4 angstrom imp
lying steric hindrance . Also in propane the methyl to methyl distance is 2.5 angstrom whereas the c
ombined van der Waals radii are much larger ( 4 angstrom ) . In the Gronert model these repulsive 1,
3 interactions account for trends in bond dissociation energies which for example decrease going fro
m methane to ethane to isopropane to neopentane . In this model the homolysis of a C-H bond releases
 strain energy in the alkane . In traditional bonding models the driving force is the ability of alk
yl groups to donate electrons to the newly formed free radical carbon .See also Joback methodReferen
