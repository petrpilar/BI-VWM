e stabilized by creating microtubule new synapses begins with initial contact between cells via cell
-cell adhesion . This contact often occurs between either axonal or dendritic filopodia , which are 
highly dynamic and rarely stabilize . Next , the adhesive contact is converted to a nascent synapse 
, which contains glutamatergic NMDA receptors , but not AMPA receptors . However , the activation of
 NMDARs by glutamate can trigger the recruitment of AMPARs from the postsynaptic density . They also
 have a relatively high concentration of dense-core vesicles , which are thought to deliver structur
al proteins to the presynaptic site .Synapse MaturationMaturation of glutamatergic synapses involves
 changes in the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission , as well as in the NMDAR
