cated near Portsmouth , Ohio and Paducah , Kentucky . The storage of DUF 6 presents environmental , 
health , and safety risks because of its chemical instability . When UF 6 is exposed to water vapor 
in the air , it reacts with the moisture to produce UO 2 F 2 ( uranyl fluoride ) , a solid , and HF 
( hydrogen fluoride ) , a gas , both of which are highly soluble and toxic . The uranyl fluoride sol
id acts to plug the leak , limiting further escape of depleted UF 6 . Release of the hydrogen fluori
de gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation . Storage cylinders are regularly insp
ected for signs of corrosion and leaks , and are repainted and repaired as necessary . A tenfold U.S
. depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth $7.6 billion , assuming DOE re-enriches the tails .
 This estimate is based on February 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services , and DOE 
's access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity . There have been several accidents involving ur
