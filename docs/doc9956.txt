ic acid and ammonium persulfate . The reaction resembles Friedel-Crafts alkylation but with opposite
 reactivity and selectivity . The Minisci reaction proceeds regioselectively and enables the introdu
ction of a wide range of alkyl groups . A side-reaction is acylation . The ratio between alkylation 
and acylation depends on the substrate and the reaction conditions . Due to the simple raw materials
 and the simple reaction conditions the reaction has many applications in heterocyclic chemistry .Me
chanismA free radical is formed from the carboxylic acid in an oxidative decarboxylation with silver
 salts and an oxidizing agent . The oxidizing agent reoxidizes the silver salt . The radical then re
acts by rearomatisation . The acylated product is formed from the acyl radical .ReferencesRoseman Un
