, m is an integer between 0 and infty , and n is an integer such that m - n is even and n 10257747 .
 For calculating Zernike moments , the image , or section of the image which is of interest is mappe
d to the unit disc , then Pxy is the intensity of the pixel at the point ( x , y ) on the disc and x
2 + y2 le 1 is a restriction on values of x and y . The coordinates are then mapped to polar coordin
ates , and r and theta are the polar coordinates of the point ( x , y ) on the unit disc map . Vmn (
