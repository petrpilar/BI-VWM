cumbing to such attacks . The ADN generally employs a number of protections against typical network 
layer attacks though it does not implement the full security offered by an IPS . Some of the Network
 Layer Security technologies that may be employed by ADN devices include :Delayed bindingDelayed bin
ding , also called TCP splicing , is the postponement of the connection between the client and the s
erver in order to obtain sufficient information to make a routing decision . Some application switch
es and routers delay binding the client session to the server until the proper handshakes are comple

 IP addresses may be employed .Traffic managementADNs are increasingly adding advanced some of these
