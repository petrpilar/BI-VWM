loped by Xin-She Yang in 2010 . This bat algorithm is based on the echolocation behaviour of microba
ts with varying pulse rates of emission and loudness.Algorithm DescriptionThe idealization of the ec
holocation of microbats can be summarized as follows : Each virtual bat flies randomly with a veloci
ty vi at position ( solution ) xi with a varying frequency or wavelength and loudness Ai . As it sea
