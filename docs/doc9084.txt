nd 38 products worldwide , a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&ampD is being invested ever
y year . As the nanomedicine industry significant impact on the economy .Medical use of nanomaterial
sTwo forms of nanomedicine that have already been tested in mice and are awaiting human trials that 
will be using gold nanoshells to help diagnose and treat cancer , and using liposomes as vaccine adj
uvants and as vehicles for drug transport . Similarly , drug detoxification is also another applicat
ion for nanomedicine which has shown promising results in rats . A benefit of using nanoscale for me
dical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside th
e body , plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter . These devices are faster and more sensit
ive than typical drug delivery . Advances in Lipid nanotechnology was also instrumental in engineeri
ng medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications
