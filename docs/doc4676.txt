d displayed on the computer screen . This method is halfway between old film-based technology and cu
rrent direct digital imaging technology . It is similar to the film process because it involves the 
same image support handling but differs in that the chemical development process is replaced by scan
ning . This is not much faster than film processing and the resolution and sensitivity performances 
are contested . PSP has been described as having an advantage of fitting within any pre-existing equ
ipment without modification because it replaces the existing film and replacement of scratched plate
