he study and in the late 1800s energetics was understood to be incompatible with the atomic view of 
the atom forwarded by Boltzmann 's gas theory . Proof of . In the 1920s Lotka then attempted to buil
d on Boltzmann 's views through a mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary 
theory . Lotka proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum
 useful energy flow transformation . This view subsequently influenced the further development of ec
ological energetics , especially the work of Howard T. Odum . De Villamil attempted to clarify the s
cope of energetics with respects to other branches of physics by contriving a system that divides me
chanics into two branches energetics ( the science of energy ) and pure , abstract or rigid dynamics
 ( the science of momentum ) . According to Villamil energetics can be mathematically characterised
