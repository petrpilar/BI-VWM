the field of ecological energetics H.T. Odum considered maximum power , the fourth principle of ener
getics . Odum also proposed the Maximum empower principle as a corollary of the maximum power princi
ple , and considered it to describe the propensities of evolutionary self-organization. Fifth princi
ple of energetics : The energy quality factor increases hierarchically . From studies of ecological 
food chains , Odum proposed that energy transformations form a hierarchical series measured by Trans
formity increase ( Odum 2000 , p. 246 ) . Flows of energy develop hierarchical webs in which energy 
forms of higher quality that feedback amplifier actions , helping to maximise the power of the syste
