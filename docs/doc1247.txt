ype of the lamp and , to a lesser extent , by fill pressure . The resistance in flashtubes is not co
nstant , but quickly drops as current density increases . In 1965 , Goncz showed that square root of
 current density . As the arc develops , the lamp experiences a period of negative resistance , caus
ing the resistance to decrease as the current increases . This occurs until the plasma comes into co
ntact with the inner wall . When this happens , the voltage becomes proportional to the square root 
of current , and the resistance in the plasma becomes stable for the remainder of the flash . It is 
this value which is defined as K o . However , as the arc develops the gas expands , and calculation
s for K o do not take into account the dead volume , which leads to a lower pressure increase . Ther
efore , any calculation of K o is merely an approximation of lamp impedance.Output spectrum XenonA x
