ne of the NACA Lockheed 12s was used to test hotwing deicing technology , in which hot exhaust air f
rom the engines was ducted through the wing 's leading edge to prevent ice accumulation . Three othe
r Lockheed 12s were used to test tricycle landing gear . These had their normal landing gear replace
d by a non-retracting version with a large nosewheel and with the main wheels shifted further back o
n the engine nacelles . ( The tailwheel from the normal conventional gear was retained . ) The gear 
was non-retractable because there was n't room within the structure to stow it in retracted position
 . Streamlined fairings were placed on the gear to reduce drag.One of the tricycle gear Lockheed 12s
 went to the U.S. Navy as the XJO-3 and performed carrier landing tests on the to study the suitabil
ity of a twin-engined tricycle-gear aircraft for carrier operations . Another went to the U.S. Army 
as the C-40B , and still another was retained by Lockheed for its own testing both gear configuratio
