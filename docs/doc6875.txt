-hydroxycyclohexanone dehydrogenase ( ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction : 3-hydrox
ycyclohexanone + acceptor rightleftharpoons cyclohexane-1,3-dione + reduced acceptor Thus , the two 
substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxycyclohexanone and acceptor , whereas its two products are cyc
lohexane-1,3-dione and reduced acceptor . This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , spe
cifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors . The systematic name of thi
s enzyme class is 3173867TOOLONG 1-oxidoreductase . birthplace = Glen Ridge , New Jersey United Stat
