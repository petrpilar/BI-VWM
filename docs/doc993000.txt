r overlooking the battlements . Unable to endure her suffering , she threw herself ( or was she push
ed ? ) to her death from the tower . The ghost of the White Lady has been seen a number of times ove
r the years , often in the grounds surrounding the castle at night . She has also been seen in the b
edroom in which she was imprisoned . The families that claim to have seen her report that she does n
ot seem to cause fear and appears harmless . A second ghost who is claimed to haunt the castle is th
at of a young boy dressed in a double-breasted sailing jacket . He has been seen in the room from wh
ich the White Lady is said to have jumped and there is speculation that he may be the son of Colonel
 Adrian Gordon Paterson . The Colonel 's only son Richard drowned in 1939 in a yachting accident on 
the River Tay . It is interesting that he should appear in the room occupied by the White Lady and i
t has been suggested that the presence of her ghost has easily appear there .ReferencesScottish Haun
