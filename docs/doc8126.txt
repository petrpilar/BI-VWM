 downgrade degenerate phase toward grasses . These phases would occur in a predictable cycle . Watts
 study has since become a classic example frequently cited in scientific ecology .Modeling cyclic su
ccessionThe cyclic model of succession can be displayed in terms of a transition matrix . Based on t
he Markov chain , the matrix describes the likelihood of future states based on the milieu of presen
t states . The three states in the simplest cyclic model are open substrate ( usually a bare patch o
f land ) , Species A dominance , and Species B dominance . With respect to facilitation , inhibition
 , and tolerance models of succession , the key feature of the cyclic model is that A and B are not 
autosuccessional that Rather , A will either facilitate the succession of B or be eliminated ( throu
gh mortality ) such that the patch occupied becomes open substrate . Likewise , B will either facili
tate the succession of A or be eliminated . Open substrate can remain open or become occupied by eit
