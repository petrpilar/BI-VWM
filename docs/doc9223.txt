 , USAF Captain Mark Postai crashed with a MiG-23 . On 26 April 1984 , USAF Lieutenant General Rober
t M. Bobby Bond , then vice commander of Air Force Systems Command , died attempting to eject after 
losing control of his MiG-23 while supersonic . A few hours after the crash , Headquarters , Air For
ce Systems Command , at Andrews Air Force Base , Maryland , vice commander , Air Force Systems Comma
nd , was killed today in an accident while flying in an Air Force specially modified test aircraft .
 Three-star generals do not generally fly test missions , so Bond 's death attracted press interest 
. The fact that the Air Force also refused to identify the type of plane also raised questions . Ear
ly reports claimed he had been flying a super-secret Stealth fighter prototype . The death of a thre
e-star general led the Air Force to reveal that it was flying Soviet aircraft . A boulevard cut-off 
between Eglin Air Force Base ( main base ) and Hurlburt Field in Florida is named in his honor .End
