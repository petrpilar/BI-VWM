 for the measurement of three types of internal activity ( a ) change of perspective , ( b ) monolog
ue and ( c ) dialogue . The purpose of this questionnaire is to induce the subjects self-reflection 
and determine whichI-positions are reflected by the participants interlocutors and which of them giv
e new and different points of view to the person . The method includes a list of potential positions
 . The participants are invited to choose some of them and can add their own to the list . The selec
ted positions , both internal and external ones , are then assessed as belonging to the dialogue , m
onologue of perspective categories . Such a questionnaire is well-suited for the investigation of co
rrelations with other questionnaires . For example , correlating the Initial Questionnaire with the 
Revised NEO Personality Inventory ( NEO PI-R ) , the researchers found that persons having inner dia
logues scored significantly lower on Assertiveness and higher on people having internal monologues .
