lems for nanomedicine involve understanding the issues related to toxicity and environmental impact 
of nanoscale materials ( materials whose structure is on the scale of nanometers , i.e. billionths o
f a meter ) . Nanomedicine research is receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health .
 Of note is the funding in 2005 of a five-year plan to set up four nanomedicine centers . In April 2
006 , the journal Nature Materials estimated that 130 nanotech-based drugs and delivery systems were
 being developed worldwide .OverviewThe biological and medical research communities have exploited t
he unique properties of nanomaterials for various applications ( e.g. , contrast agents for cell ima
ging and therapeutics for treating cancer ) . Terms such asbiomedical nanotechnology,nanobiotechnolo
gy, andnanomedicineare used to describe this hybrid field . Functionalities can be added to nanomate
rials by of nanomaterials is similar to that of most biological molecules and structures therefore ,
