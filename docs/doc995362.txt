eaction intermediates and transition states because heavier isotopes form stronger bonds with other 
atoms . Atomic mass affects the zero-point vibrational state of the associated molecules , shorter a
nd stronger bonds in molecules with heavier isotopes and longer , weaker bonds in molecules with lig
ht isotopes . Because vibrational motions will often change during a course of a reaction , due to t
he making and breaking of bonds , the frequencies will be affected , and the substitution of an law 
.Substituent effectsThe study of how substituents affect the reactivity of a molecule or the rate of
 reactions is of significant interest to chemists . Substituents can exert an effect through both st
eric and electronic interactions , the latter of which include resonance and inductive effects . The
 polarizability of molecule can also be affected . Most substituent effects are analyzed through lin
ear free energy relationships ( LFREs ) . The most common of these is the Hammett Plot Analysis . Th
