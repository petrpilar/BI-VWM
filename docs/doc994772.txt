tion of hypochlorite ( for example in commercial bleach formulations ) , a direct titration with thi
osulfate can be employed without recourse to an iodometric finish . : ClO  + H 2 O + 2e  &ampharr Cl

metric iodometric titrations employing thiosulfate as a titrant are also practical , for example in 
the determination of Cu(II) . In this instance , it has been found advantageous to incorporate the p
otassium iodide reagent with the thiosulfate titrant in such proportions that iodine is released int
o solution just prior to its reduction by thiosulfate . This minimizes iodine losses during the cour
se of the titration.Titrations with hypochloriteWhile relatively unstable and requiring frequent sta
ndardization , sodium hypochlorite has been used in a very rapid thermometric titration method for t
