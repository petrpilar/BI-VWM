un at all latitudes . To do this required a major orbital plane shift . Due to velocity change limit
ations of the Shuttle and the Inertial Upper Stage ( IUS ) , this was accomplished by using an an en
gine burn . The need for a Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells 
and was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( RTG ) instead . By February 2008 , the 
power output from the RTG , which is generated by heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 ,
 had decreased enough to leave insufficient power for internal heaters to keep the spacecraft 's att
itude control hydrazine fuel from freezing . The end of mission was at one-point scheduled for July 
1 , 2008 , but mission scientists came up with a method to keep the fuel liquid by conducting a shor
t thruster burn every two hours , allowing the mission to continue . The cessation of mission operat
ions and deactivation or hibernation of the spacecraft was determined by the inability to prevent at
