key is near the bottom of the circle ( a key signature of many accidentals ) , and particularly if t
he new key is on the opposite side ( in the late Classical and Romantic eras ) , it becomes necessar
y to consider enharmonic equivalence . In each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths th
e two enharmonic equivalentscanbe notated and so do not classify as ' theoretical keys ' :The need t
o consider theoretical keysBut when a relative key ascends the opposite theory suggests that double-
sharps and double-flats would have to be incorporated into the notated key signature . The following
 six keys ( which are the parallel major/minor keys of those above ) would require one , two or thre
e double-sharps or double-flats : For example , pieces in the major mode commonly modulate up a fift
h to the dominant for a key with sharps in the signature this leads to a key whose key signature has
 an additional sharp . A piece in C which performs this modulation would lead to the theoretical key
