olumn to the right the first element of the row is zero . the followingn&ampminus 2 rows are obtaine
d the same way , still filling the first column with a zero . the (n+ 1 ) th row is : : beginpmatrix
 qn &amp qn-1 &amp cdots &amp q1 &amp q0 &amp 0 &amp cdots &amp 0 endpmatrix. the following rows are
 obtained the same way as before . Thus , ifm= 4 andn= 3 , the matrix is : : Sp , q=beginpmatrix p4 
&amp p3 &amp p2 &amp p1 &amp p0 &amp 0 &amp 0 0 &amp p4 &amp p3 &amp p2 &amp p1 &amp p0 &amp 0 0 &am

mials have a ( non constant ) common factor . In such a case , the determinant of the associated Syl
vester matrix ( which is named the resultant of the two polynomials ) equals zero . The converse is
