 , Uni XS and other devices ) Due to their high-intensity and relative brightness at short wavelengt
hs ( extending into the ultraviolet ) and short pulse widths , flashtubes are also ideally suited as
 light sources for pumping atoms in a laser to excited states where they can subsequently be stimula
ted to emit coherent monochromatic light . Proper selection of the filler gas is crucial here , so t
he maximum of radiated output energy is concentrated in the bands that are the best absorbed by the 
lasing medium e.g. krypton flashtubes are more suitable than xenon flashtubes for pumping Nd:YAG las
ers , as krypton emission in near infrared is better matched to the absorption spectrum of Nd:YAG . 
Xenon flashtubes have been used to produce an intense flash of white light , some of which is absorb
ed by Nd:glass that produces the laser power for inertial confinement fusion . In total about 1 to 1
.5% of the electrical power fed into the flashtubes is turned into useful laser light for this appli
