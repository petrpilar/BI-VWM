0000 km/h.CharacteristicsBecause of the Moon 's lack of water , and atmosphere , or tectonic plates 
, there is little erosion , and craters are found that exceed two billion years in age . The age of 
large craters is determined by the number of smaller craters contained within it , older craters gen
erally accumulating more small , contained craters . The smallest craters found have been microscopi
c in size , found in rocks returned to Earth from the Moon . The largest crater called such is lunar
 South Pole . However , it is believed that many of the lunar maria were formed by giant impacts , w
ith the resulting depression filled by upwelling lava . Craters typically will have some or all of t
he following features : a surrounding area with materials splashed out of the ground when the crater
 was formed this is typically lighter in shade than older materials due to exposure to solar radiati
on for a lesser time raised rim , consisting of materials ejected but landing very close by crater w
