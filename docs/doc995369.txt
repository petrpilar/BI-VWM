en atom , theory predicts a set of four bonding molecular orbitals which are delocalized across the 
entire molecule . Similarly , the true electronic structure of 1,3-butadiene shows delocalized -bond
ing molecular orbitals stretching through the entire molecule rather than two isolated A complete el
ectronic structure offers great predictive power for organic transformations and dynamics , especial
ly in cases concerning aromatic molecules , extended systems , bonds between metal ions and organic 
molecules , molecules containing nonstandard heteroatoms like selenium and boron , and the conformat
ional dynamics of large molecules such as proteins wherein the many approximations in chemical forma
lisms make structure and reactivity prediction impossible . An example of how electronic structure d
etermination is a useful tool for the physical organic chemist is the metal-catalyzed dearomatizatio
