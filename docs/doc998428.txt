h the blurry and pixelated images , or noisy sound transmission , associated with poor internet band
width . The Holometer seeks to detect the equivalent blurriness or noise in reality itself , associa
ted with the ultimate frequency limit imposed by nature . Craig Hogan , a particle astrophysicist at
 Fermilab , states about the experiment , What were looking for is when the lasers lose step with ea
ch other . Were trying to detect the smallest unit in the universe . This is really great fun , a so
rt of old-fashioned physics experiment where you physicist Hartmut Grote of the Max Planck Institute
 in Germany states that although he is skeptical that the apparatus will successfully detect the hol
ographic fluctuations , if the experiment is successful it would be a very strong impact to one of t
he most open questions in fundamental physics . It would be the first proof that space-time , the fa
bric of the universe , is quantized . The hypothesis that holographic noise may be observed in this
