 nanomaterials can be useful for both in vivo and in vitro biomedical research and applications . Th
us far , the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devi
ces , contrast agents , analytical tools , physical therapy applications , and drug delivery vehicle
s . Nanomedicine seeks to deliver a valuable set of research tools and clinically useful devices in 
the near future . The National Nanotechnology Initiative expects new commercial applications in the 
pharmaceutical industry that may include advanced drug delivery systems , new therapies , and in viv
o imaging . Neuro-electronic interfaces and other nanoelectronics-based sensors are another active g
oal of research . Further down the line , the speculative field of molecular nanotechnology believes
 that cell repair machines could revolutionize medicine and the medical field . Nanomedicine is a la
rge industry , with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004 , and with over 200 companies a
