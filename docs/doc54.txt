ies , exaggerated Norwegian nationalism , and trollish self-satisfaction ! But I have a hunch that t
he irony will be discernible . Grieg 'sHolberg Suitewas originally written for the piano , and later
 arranged by the composer for string orchestra . Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets H
einrich Heine , Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , Henrik Ibsen , Hans Christian Andersen , Rudyard Kiplin
g and others . Russian composer Nikolai Myaskovsky used a theme by Grieg for the variations with whi
ch he closed his Third String Quartet . Norwegian pianist Eva Knardahl recorded the composer 's comp
lete piano music during 1978 and 1980 . The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs by 
BIS Records . Grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907.List of sele
