n performance , which typically deals with increasing strength or endurance ( see powered exoskeleto
ns ) Long-term assistance , which aims to provide impaired individuals with the ability to walk by t
hemselves while wearing an exoskeleton Study of human locomotion , which utilizes robotic exoskeleto
ns to better understand human neuromuscular control , energetics , and/or kinematics of locomotion P
ost-injury rehabilitation , which is intended to help an individual recover from an injury ( such as
 disabilities ) by wearing an exoskeleton for a short time during training in order to perform bette
r later without the use of the exoskeleton Robotic lower limb exoskeletons can be controlled by seve
ral methods , including a footswitch ( a pressure sensor attached to the bottom of the foot ) , gait
 phase estimation ( using joint angles to determine the current phase of walking ) , and myoelectric
 control ( using electromyography ) . This article focuses on myoelectric control .Control MethodsSe
