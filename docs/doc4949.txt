 , as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit . Moreover ,
 honeyeaters have been observed moving from tree to tree with significant loads ofB. sessilispollen 
on their foreheads , beaks and throats , having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters wh
ile foraging for nectar experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposite
d on stigmas during later foraging . The flowers ofB. sessilishave a number of adaptations that serv
e to encourage outcrossing . Firstly , they are protandrous : a flower 's pollen is released around 
72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen , by which time around half of its pollen has
