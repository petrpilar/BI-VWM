oduction of 150 to 300 grams of carbon per square meter per year ) based on SeaWiFS global primary p
roductivity estimates . The coastal areas are highly productive and the maximum chlorophyll value is
 found around 100 meters depth . There are indications that eddies by the Kuroshio . Plankton biomas

 Kuroshio Current show results of productivity equally distributed throughout for a couple of reason
