ces encode a gene that is expressed , then the presence of RNA and/or protein products of the recomb
inant gene can be detected , typically using RT-PCR or western hybridization methods . Gross phenoty
pic changes are not the norm , unless the recombinant gene has been chosen and modified so as to gen
erate biological activity in the host organism . Additional phenotypes that are encountered include 
toxicity to the host organism induced by the recombinant gene product , especially if it is over-exp
ressed or expressed within inappropriate cells or tissues . In some cases , recombinant DNA can have
 deleterious effects even if it is not expressed . One mechanism by which this happens is insertiona
l inactivation cell 's gene . In some cases , researchers use this phenomenon to knock out genes to 
determine their biological function and importance . Another mechanism by which rDNA insertion into 
chromosomal DNA can affect gene expression is by inappropriate activation of previously unexpressed
