e song plays she does not lip sync the lyrics except for the word Yeah ! after each verse and during
 the chorus . The set lighting fades in and out throughout the video . Writing forThe Washington Pos
t, Bethonie Butler observed a discrepancy between would never do any interviews , and probably there
 would be one photo out there of her , and the fact that , in the music video , Lorde is front and c
enter . Butler viewed the video as a metaphor for celebrity . Writing for Ryan Seacrest 's website ,
 Kathleen Perricone complimented the super simple clip , which allowed Lorde 's voice and lyrics to 
really shine . Lindsay Zoladz , of Pitchfork Media , compared the video to that for The Replacements
