ry applicationsDepleted uranium is very dense at 19,050 kg/m , it less dense than tungsten and gold 
, and 84% as dense as osmium or iridium , which are the densest known substances under standard ( i.
e. , Earth-surface ) pressures . Consequently a DU projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter t
han an equivalent lead projectile , with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration due to a highe
