 as a moisturizer , MLE offers long-lasting skin moisturizing effects through reinforcing the skin '
s natural barrier function . Under cross polarized microscopy , skin lipids and MLE show the similar
 cross-like structure , termed as Maltese cross structure , and under electron microscopy , lamellar
 structures are observed . Stratum corneum , as the outermost layer of skin , is responsible for the
 various barrier function of skin and protects our body from external harmful things . Stratum corne
um lipids are elaborately role for skin 's barrier functions . Unlike the conventional moisturizers 
made with humectants or emollients , MLE can restore and improve the barrier function of skin , with
 its distinctive structural similarity to the native human skin 's lamellar structure . Restoring th
e skin barrier function can improve skin hydration and protect skin from external irritants . The ef
ficacy of MLE on skin barrier was proven by several clinical studies performed in independent Univer
