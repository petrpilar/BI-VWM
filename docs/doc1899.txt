l reaction in a flame proceeds as a free radical chain reaction are able to halt the fire at much lo
wer concentrations than are required by fire suppressants using the more traditional methods of cool
ing , oxygen deprivation , or fuel dilution . For example , Halon 1301 total flooding systems are ty
pically used at concentrations no higher than 7% by volume in air , and can suppress many fires at 2
.9% v/v . By contrast , carbon dioxide fire suppression flood systems operate from 34% concentration
 by volume ( surface-only combustion of liquid fuels ) up to 75% ( dust traps ) . Carbon dioxide can
 cause severe distress at concentrations of 36% , and has caused death by respiratory paralysis in a
 few minutes at 10% concentration . Halon 1301 causes only slight giddiness at its effective concent
ration of 5% , and even at 15% those exposed remain conscious but impaired and suffer no long term e
ffects . ( Experimental animals have also been exposed to 2% concentrations of Halon 1301 for 30 hou
