olve this problem . Instead of using the areas of rectangles , which put the focus on the domain of 
the function , Lebesgue looked at the codomain of the function for his fundamental unit of area . Le
besgue 's idea was to first define measure , for both sets build the integral for what he called sim
ple functions measurable functions that take only finitely many values . Then he defined it for more
 complicated functions as the least upper bound of all the integrals of simple functions smaller tha
n the function in question . Lebesgue integration has the property that every function defined over 
a bounded interval with a Riemann integral also has a Lebesgue integral , and for those functions th
e two integrals agree . Furthermore , every bounded function on a closed bounded interval has a Lebe
sgue integral and there are many functions with a Lebesgue integral that have no Riemann integral . 
As part of the development of Lebesgue integration , Lebesgue invented the concept of measure , whic
