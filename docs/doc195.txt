 acid . The disintegration of the cores releases the insulin which controls the blood sugar level to
 the normal range .CancerThe small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be ver
y useful in oncology , particularly in imaging . Quantum dots ( nanoparticles with quantum confineme
nt properties in conjunction with MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , can produce exceptional image
s of tumor sites . These nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light s
ource for excitation . This means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher co
ntrast image and at a lower cost than today 's organic dyes used as contrast media . The downside , 
however , is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements . Another nanoproperty , hig
h surface area to volume ratio , allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle , wh
ich can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells . Additionally , the small size of nanoparticles (
