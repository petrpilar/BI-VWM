paratusAll the tests were made in the Langley two-dimensional measures 3 x 7.5 feet , and the model 
completely spanned the 3-foot dimension . Seals were installed between the ends of the model and the
 tunnel walls to prevent air leakage .Test results DragThe reaction of the minimum drag coefficient 
of smooth airfoils to increasing RN is attributed to the relative strengths of two interacting bound
ary-layer changes . A thinning of the boundary layer with increasing RN gives a gradual decrease of 
minimum drag . As the RN is increased beyond a certain value , however , the transition point begins
 to move forward and the drag increases . The flow conditions of the thicker airfoils are more favor
able for delaying the forward movement of transition . The addition of standard roughness to the NAC
A 63-009 section causes a large increase in the minimum drag at all RN , but increasing the RN has a
 favorable effect in reducing the drag . Increasing the RN from 9.0 to 15.0 million resulted in the
