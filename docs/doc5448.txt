 of six primitive camping sites and two concrete boat ramps . The synaptotropic hypothesis , also ca
lled the synaptotrophic hypothesis , is a neurobiological hypothesis of neuronal growth and synapse 
formation . The hypothesis was first formulated by J.E . Vaughn in 1988 , and remains a focus of cur
rent research efforts . The synaptotropic hypothesis proposes that input from a presynaptic to a pos
tsynaptic cell ( and maturation of excitatory synaptic inputs ) eventually can change the course of 
synapse formation at dendritic and axonal arbors . This synapse formation is required for the develo
pment of neuronal structure in the functioning brain .Dendritic Arbor Development GrowthDendrites of
 central nervous system neurons grow by addition and retraction of thin branches . This process is h
ighly dynamic . Only a small fraction of newly added branches are actually maintained to become long
-lasting components of the arbor . This process suggests that the branches sample the environment to
