The French and Indian force was in fact much larger than anticipated , and moved swiftly . They over
whelmed McDonald 's decoy force and overran the party that had been meant to ambush them . Lewis 's 
force left its ambush positions and went to the aid of the rest of the force but the French and Indi
ans had by then gained a point of high ground above them and forced them to retire concealed by a th
ick foliage , their heavy and destructive fire could not be returned with any effect . In the one-si
ded battle in the woods , the British and American force suffered 342 casualties , of whom 232 were 
from the 77th Regiment , including Grant , who was taken prisoner . Out of the eight officers in And
rew Lewiss Virginian contingent , 5 were killed , 1 was wounded and Lewis himself was captured . Nev
ertheless , most of Grant 's force escaped to rejoin the main army under Forbes and Bouquet . The Fr
anco-Indian force suffered only 8 killed and 8 wounded . A plaque on the Allegheny County Courthouse
