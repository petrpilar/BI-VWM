r networks of stream channels , called Warrego Valles , were discovered here by early orbiters . Ano
ther sign of water is the presence of gullies carved into steep slopes .Martian GulliesGullies are c
ommon in some parts of Mars . Gullies occur on steep slopes , especially on the walls of craters . M
artian gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few , if any craters . Moreover
 , they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young . Usually , each 
gully has an alcove , channel , and apron . Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes tha
t face all directions , others have poleward facing slopes , especially from 30-44 S. Although many 
ideas have been put forward to explain them , the most popular involve liquid water coming from an a
quifer , from melting at the base of old glaciers , or from the melting of ice in the ground when th
e climate was warmer . Because of the good possibility that liquid water was involved with their for
