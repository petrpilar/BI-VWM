 described in 1963 in Australia , is the result of an alteration in glycosylation of glycophorin C :
 an A to G transition at nucleotide 23 results in an asparagine residue instead of the normal serine
 residue with the resultant loss of glycoslation . The antigen is known as GPC Wb.Duch antigenThe ra
re Duch ( Dh ) antigen was discovered in Aarhus , Denmark ( 1968 ) and is also found on glycophorin 
C. It is due to a C to T transition at nucleotide 40 resulting in the replacement of leucine by phen
ylalanine . This antigen is sensitive to trypsin but resistant to chymotrypsin and Endo F.Lewis anti
genThe Lewis II ( Ls(a) Ge-6 ) antigen has insert of 84 nucleotides into entire sequence of exon 3 .
 Two subtypes of this antigen are known : beta Ls(a) which carries the Ge3 epitope and gamma Ls(a) w
hich carries both the Ge2 and Ge3 epitopes . This antigen is also known as the Rs(a) antigen.Ahonen 
antigenThe Ahonen ( Ana ) antigen was first reported in 1972 . The antigen is found on glycophorin D
