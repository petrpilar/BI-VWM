otchkiss Hall . In 2011 , the museum moved to a new building , Thomas D Shaffner Hall , across from 
the Advanced Technology Development Complex . It is named for Thomas Shaffner , a Michigan Tech alum
nus who donated $1 million for the new museum . The museum was designated the official Mineralogical
 Museum of Michigan in 1990 by the Michigan Legislature . There are plans to relocate the museum to 
the Quincy Mine , another part of the Keweenaw National Historical Park . The new museum will be loc
ated in the renovated Quincy Mine blacksmith and machine shop buildings that are preexisting on the 
site . The new museum location is larger than its current location and will offer more space to disp
lay mineral specimens . There is also room for a sufficient number of parking spaces for visitors to
 be put on Keweenaw National Historic Park and it will be more visible and accessible to visitors .C
