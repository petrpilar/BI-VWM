e amount of data queued for transmission in each modem . While this adaptive duplex scheme was able 
to send large files quickly , for users accustomed to having the distant computer echo characters , 
the delay associated with having the DSPs take turns using the bandwidth tended make interactive typ
ing difficult , as there could be as much as a second and a half delay for a single character echo .
 This also caused problems for file transfer protocols , e.g. , UUCP ' g ' or Kermit , where a small
 packet of data was sent by one computer , followed by a wait for acknowledgment from the receiver (
 send and wait ) . The TrailBlazer addressed this problem through a technique known as protocol spoo
fing . When the local computer sent a packet to the modem for ACK message , generated locally . This
 fooled the computer into thinking the packet had already reached the far end , prompting it to send
 another packet . The error correction normally being applied in the protocol was instead handled us
