rom seven teeth , six of which represent four species of dryolestoidsa group of primitive mammals th
at dominates the Late Cretaceous mammalian faunas of Argentina . The fauna was described in a 2009 p
aper by Guillermo Rougier and colleagues , who namedTrapalcotheriumas well as several new dryolestoi
ds . The generic name ,Trapalcotherium, combines the name of the basin where Cerro Tortuga is locate
d , Bajo Trapalca , with the Greektherionbeast , commonly used to mean mammal in scientific names . 
The specific name ,matuastensis, derives from Puesto El Matuesto , a shed used by the paleontologist
s who collected the single tooth ofTrapalcotheriumis identified as a lower molar because it has two 
longitudinal rows of cusps as a first molar because it is longer than wide and as a left tooth becau
se the left side ( interpreted as labial , in the direction of the lips ) bears more cusps than the 
right side ( lingual , the direction of the tongue ) . The tooth is 2.48 mm long and 2.07 mm wide .
