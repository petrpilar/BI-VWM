the initial phase after virion disassembly , and in the productive phase when it assembles into repl
icated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins . L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation si
gnals ( NLSs ) other at the C-terminal ( cNLS ) . L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of kar
yopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways . L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 wa
s shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) . L2 capsid proteins can also intera
ct with viral dsDNA , facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.
