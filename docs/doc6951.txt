talyzes the chemical reaction : dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate + H 2 O rightleftharpoons dolichy
l phosphate + D-glucose Thus , the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosph
ate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dolichyl phosphate and D-glucose . This enzyme belongs 
to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds . The systematic
 name of this enzyme class is 346496TOOLONG dolichylphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use inc
lude dolichol phosphoglucose phosphodiesterase , and Dol-P-Glc phosphodiesterase . This enzyme parti
cipates in n-glycan biosynthesis. The Valea Btcii River is a tributary of the Bistria River in Roman
