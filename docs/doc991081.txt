iles travel north with the Kuroshio Current . They are turned inshore and are caught between the isl
ands of Honshu and Hokkaido during the summer . The summer spawning is in another part of the East C
hina Sea , from which the larvae are entrained into the Tsushima current that flows north between th
e islands of Japan and the mainland . Afterward , the current meets a southward flowing cold coastal
 current , the Liman Current , and the summer-spawned squid are fished along the boundary between th
e two . This illustrates the use of these western boundary currents as a rapid transport that enable
 the eggs and larvae to develop during winter in warm water , while the adults travel with minimum e
nergy expenditure to exploit the rich northern feeding grounds . Studies have reported that annual c
atches in Japan have gradually increased since the late 1980s and it has been proposed that changing
 environmental conditions have caused the autumn and winter spawning areas in the Tsushima Strait an
