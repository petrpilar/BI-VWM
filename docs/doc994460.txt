subunit composition . Further , it includes the assembly of the postsynaptic density , which is a pr
otein-dense region with both structural and signaling functions . Synaptic vesicles are also recruit
ed , resulting in an increase in the reliability of synaptic transmission .Neuronal ArchitectureAlth
ough neurons generally follow a basic morphological pattern ( consisting of the tree-like dendritic 
arbor , a cell body , and an axonal unique to every neuron and are central to understanding their co
mplex neural function . The synaptotropic hypothesis implies that function drives form , since the a
ppropriateness of new synapses is constantly being tested by the filopodia in the first stages of de
ndritogenesis , thus determining the form of the neural architecture .Modifications of the Hypothesi
sSome interpret the synaptotropic hypothesis as saying that manipulations that increase synapse form
ation and maturation promote formation of larger dendritic arbors , while treatments that reduce syn
