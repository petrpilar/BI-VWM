) in the titration curve where sensor response is plotted against the amount of titrant delivered . 
However , free energy is just one of three related parameters in describing any chemical reaction : 
:H 0 =G 0 +T S 0 ( 2 ) where : :H 0 = change in enthalpy :G 0 = change in free energy :S 0 = change 
in entropy :T= temperature in K For any reaction where the free energy is not opposed by the entropy
 change , the enthalpy change will be significantly greater than the free energy . Thus a titration 
based on a change in temperature ( which permits observation of the enthalpy change ) will show a gr
eater inflection than will curves obtained from sensors reacting to free energy changes alone .added
 at a known constant rate to a titrand until the completion of the reaction is indicated by a change
 in temperature . The endpoint is determined by an inflection in the curve generated by the output o
f a temperature measuring device . Consider the titration reaction : :aA +bB =pP ( 3 ) Where : : A =
