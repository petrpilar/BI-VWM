er the purified char with minimal loss to combustion . This is accomplished by either burning the pa
rent fuel ( wood or coal ) in a low-oxygen environment or by heating it to a high temperature withou
t allowing combustion to occur . In industrial production of coke and charcoal the volatile compound
s driven off during charring are often captured for use in other chemical processes . A coal burning
 blacksmith 's forge actually produces the heat necessary for high-temperature metalworking by the c
ontinuous production and consumption of coke within a carefully managed fire . An inner ring of burn
ing coke provides heat which converts the encircling coal into coke , which is then itself fed into 
the center of the fire to provide the required heat and to create more coke coal itself is incapable
 of producing the heat required for some blacksmithing operations .Charring and fire protectionCharr
ing is an important process in the combustion ignition of solid fuels and in smouldering . In constr
