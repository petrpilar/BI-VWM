ge ( ) , nearly circular pit crater . Multiple examples of pit craters have been observed on Mercury
 on the floors of impact craters , leading to the name pit-floor craters for the impact structures t
hat host these features . Unlike impact craters , pit craters are rimless , often irregularly shaped
 , steep-sided , and often display no associated ejecta or lava flows . These pit craters are though
t to be evidence of shallow volcanic activity and may have formed when retreating magma caused an un
supported area of the surface to collapse , creating a pit . They are analogs of Earth 's volcanic c
alderas . Pit-floor craters may provide an indication of internal igneous processes where other evid
ence of volcanic processes is absent or ambiguous . The discovery of multiple pit-floor craters augm
ents evidence that volcanic activity has been a widespread process in the geologic evolution of Merc
ury 's crust . The Capivari River ( Rio de Janeiro ) is a river of Rio de Janeiro state in southeast
