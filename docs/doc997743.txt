iginally designed for aircraft applications . Lack of sufficient research caused enormous reliabilit
y problems , especially in regions requiring the use of salt on winter roads , such as sticking and 
corrosion . Drum brake conversion for Hot Shots was quite popular . The Chrysler 4-wheel disc brake 
system was more complex and expensive than Crosley 's , but far more efficient and reliable . It was
 St. Joseph , Michigan , under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert , and was first tested on a 1939 Ply
mouth . Unlike the caliper disc , the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed agains
t the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum , which doubled as the brake housing . The discs sprea

ders . Chrysler discs were self energizing , in that some of the braking energy itself contributed t
o the braking effort . This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake
