. The mortician masturbates to orgasm while fondling Marta 's breasts and innards , then takes photo
graphs of his handiwork . Unable to contain his lust any longer , the mortician engages in necrophil

 Marta , cleans up , and leaves . In his home , the pajama-clad mortician blends Marta 's stolen hea
