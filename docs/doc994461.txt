apse maturation result in smaller arbors . However , the opposite result has been found in different
 manipulations of the molecular pathways underlying synaptogeneis . A resulting modified version of 
the hypothesis has emerged in which graded levels of synaptic maturation produce corresponding level
s of stabilization . This is a different way of viewing the synaptotropic hypothesis that still take
s into account the molecular mechanisms of dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis.Supporting EvidenceThe
 synaptotropic hypothesis would predict that cell adhesion molecules that are important in synapse f
ormation would also greatly affect dendritic arbor growth . This has been shown to be the case with 
cadherins . receptors are expressed in individualXenopusneurons , trafficking of AMPA receptors to n
ascent synapses is minimized in those cells . These cells , like normal neurons , extend and retract
 dendritic branches . In the normal cell , some of these branches would form synapses , which is not
