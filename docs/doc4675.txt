igital radiographic systemsDigital dental radiography comes in two forms : direct , that connect dir
ectly to the computer via USB and provides immediate images , and indirect ( photostimulable phospho
r plates , or PSP ) which uses plates that are radiated and then digitally scanned . Direct digital 
sensors represent a significant initial investment , but in addition to the convenience of digital i
mages , spends in the dental chair . They also reduce the need for the constant purchase of film and
 the necessary development chemicals . Early systems used CCD sensor technology , but changed to Amo
rphous Silicon ( aSi:H ) sensors following their introduction in early 1998-9 . Indirect digital ima

ay exposure the plate ( sheet ) is placed in a special scanner where the latent formed image is retr
