. The resulting residue matter is called char . By the action of heat , charring removes hydrogen an
d oxygen from the solid , so that the remaining char is composed primarily of carbon . Polymers like
 thermoset or most solid organic compounds like wood or biological tissue , exhibit charring behavio
ur . Charring is the result of naturally occurring processes like fire but also a deliberate and con
trolled reaction used in the manufacturing of certain products . The mechanism of charring is part o
f the normal burning of certain solid fuels like wood . During normal combustion the volatile compou
nds created by charring and pyrolysis are consumed at the flames within the fire , while combustion 
of char can be seen as glowing red coals or embers which burn without the presence of flames .Produc
tion of charCoke and charcoal are both produced by charring , whether on an industrial scale or thro
ugh normal combustion of coal or wood . Normal combustion consumes the char as well as seek to recov
