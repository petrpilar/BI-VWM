 the event .OriginsThe basic structural frame ofZvezda, known as DOS-8 , was initially built in the 
mid-1980s to be the core of theMir-2space station . This means thatZvezdais similar in layout to the
 core module ( DOS-7 ) of theMirspace station . It was in fact labeled asMir-2 for quite some time i
n the factory . Its design lineage thus extends back to the original Salyut stations . The space fra
me was completed in February 1985 and major internal equipment was installed by October 1986 . The M
IR-2 space station was redesigned after the failure of the Polyus orbital weapons platform core modu
le to reach orbit . Zvezda is around 1/4 the size of Polyus , and has no armaments .DesignZvezda con
sists of a cylindrical Work Compartment where the crews work and live , a cylindrical Transfer Chamb
er which has one docking port , an unpressurized Assembly Compartment surrounding three docking port
s ( four docking ports total ) . The component weighs about 18051kg lb and had a length of 13.1 m .
