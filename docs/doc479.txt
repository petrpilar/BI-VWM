SF decays were measured with a lifetime consistent with 268 Db . In order to prove that the decays w
ere from dubnium-268 , the team repeated the reaction in August 2005 and separated the +4 and +5 fra
ctions and further separated the +5 fractions into tantalum-like and niobium-like ones . Five SF act
ivities were observed , all occurring in the +5 fractions and none in the tantalum-like fractions , 
proving that the product was indeed isotopes of dubnium . In a series of experiments between October
 2010 February 2011 , scientists at the FLNR studied this reaction at a range of excitation energies
 . They were able to detect 21 atoms of 288 Uup and one atom of 289 Uup , from the 2n exit channel .
 This latter result was used to support the synthesis of ununseptium . The 3n excitation function wa
s completed with a maximum at 8 pb . The data was consistent with that found in the first experiment
s in 2003.Isotopes and nuclear properties Chemical properties Extrapolated chemical properties Oxida
