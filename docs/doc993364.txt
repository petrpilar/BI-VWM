m mechanical by their nature a theory of quantum gravity would be required to describe this behavior
 , and no such theory has yet been completed . On the other hand , only one kind of singularity has 
ever been observed ( black holes ) , and due to the mass dependent , stable radius of the connected 
event horizon , it is currently unknown if this kind of singularity actually approaches or even drop
s below scales relevant to quantum mechanics .In Star TrekA quantum singularity is in the Star Trek 
: Voyager episode Parallax . The singularity creates a mirror image and a temporal distortion . Voya
ger flies into the singularity after seeing an image of itself inside . To escape , the crew uses a 
shuttle and fires a tachyon beam at an opening created upon entry . In Voyager episode Hunters the V
oyager crew discover a Hirogen relay station almost 100,000 years old that is powered by a quantum s
ingularity . The word tiny is used to apparently describe the dimensions of the quantum singularity
