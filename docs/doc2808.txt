the namecraters. Scientific opinion as to the origin of craters swung back and forth over the ensuin
g centuries . The competing theories were ( a ) volcanic eruptions blasting holes in the Moon , ( b 
) meteoric impact , ( c ) a theory known as the Welteislehre developed in Germany between the two Wo

onclusively that meteoric impact , or impact by asteroids for larger craters , was the origin of alm
ost all lunar craters , and by implication , most craters on other bodies as well . The formation of
 new craters is studied in the lunar impact monitoring program at NASA . The biggest recorded creati
