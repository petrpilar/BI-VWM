a generalized coordinate is the angle that locates a point moving on a circle . The adjective genera
lized distinguishes these parameters from the traditional use of the term coordinate to refer to Car
tesian coordinates : for example , describing the location of the point on the circle using x and y 
coordinates . Although there may be many choices for generalized coordinates for a physical system ,
 parameters are usually selected which are convenient for the specification of the configuration of 
the system and which make the solution of its equations of motion easier . If these parameters are i
ndependent of one another , then number of independent generalized coordinates is defined by the num
ber of degrees Generalized coordinates are usually selected to provide the minimum number of indepen
dent coordinates that define the configuration of a system , which simplifies the formulation of Lag
range 's equations of motion . However , it can also occur that a useful set of generalized coordina
