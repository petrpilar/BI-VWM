y nucleophilic , allowing additions to imines in the absence of additional Lewis acid catalysts , ma
king them this high reactivity , organocerium reagents are almost entirely non-basic , tolerating th
e presence of free alcohols and amines as well as enolizable -protons . The oxophilicity of cerium i
mparts strong 1,2-selectivity in reactions with conjugated electrophiles similarly to organolithium 
reagents . At the same time , organocerium reagents can be used to synthesize ketones from acyl comp
ounds without over-addition , as seen with organocuprates . This dichotomy illustrates the unique re
activity of organolanthanide reagents . Finally , organocerium reagents have been employed in a numb
er of total syntheses . Shown below is a key coupling step in the total synthesis of roseophilin , a
 potent antitumor antibiotic . The 201011 Southern Professional Hockey League season was the seventh
 season of the Southern Professional Hockey League . The season began October 21 , 2010 , and ended
