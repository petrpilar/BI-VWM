t to Greek astronomy which was dependent upon cosmology , Babylonian astronomy was independent from 
cosmology . Whereas Greek astronomers expressed prejudice in favor of circles or spheres rotating wi
th uniform motion , such a preference did not exist for Babylonian astronomers , for whom uniform ci
rcular motion was never a requirement for planetary orbits . There is no evidence that the celestial
 bodies moved in uniform circular motion , or along celestial spheres astronomers during this period
 include the discovery of eclipse cycles and saros cycles , and many accurate astronomical observati
ons . For example , they observed that the Sun 's motion along the ecliptic was not uniform , though
 they were unaware of why this was it is today known that this is due to the Earth moving in an elli
ptic orbit around the Sun , with the Earth moving swifter when it is nearer to the Sun at perihelion
 and moving slower when it is farther away at aphelion . Chaldean astronomers known to have followed
