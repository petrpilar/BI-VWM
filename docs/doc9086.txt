nefit by reducing the amount of drug needed in an equipotent preparation of said therapy , and thus 
reduced cost to the consumer . Nanomedical approaches to drug delivery center on developing nanoscal
e particles or molecules to improve drug bioavailability . Bioavailability refers to the presence of
 drug molecules where they are needed in the body and where they will do the most good . Drug delive
ry focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of ti
me . This can potentially be achieved by targeting the molecules and delivering drugs with cell prec
ision . More than $65 billion are wasted each year due to poor bioavailability .In vivoimaging is an
other area where tools and devices are being developed . Using nanoparticle contrast agents , images
 such as ultrasound and MRI have a favorable distribution and improved contrast . The new methods of
 nanoengineered materials that are being developed might be effective in treating illnesses and dise
