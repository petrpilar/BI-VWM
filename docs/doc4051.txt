anifold , but on inline-type engines both turbochargers can be mounted to a single turbo manifold . 
Parallel twin turbos applied to V-shaped engines are usually mounted with one turbo assigned to each
 cylinder bank , providing packaging symmetry and simplifying plumbing over a single turbo setup . W
hen used on inline engines parallel twin turbos are commonly applied with two smaller turbos , which
 can provide similar . Some examples of parallel twin-turbo inline engines are Nissan 's RB26DETT , 
BMW 's N54 and Volvo 's B6284T and B6294T . Some examples of V formation engines with parallel twin-
turbos include Mitsubishi 's 6A12TT and 6G72TT Nissan 's VG30DETT and VR38DETT and Audi 's 1997-2002
 S4 ( B5 ) , 1997-2005 A6 , and 2003-2004 RS6 . While a parallel twin-turbo set-up theoretically has
 less turbo lag than a single turbocharger set up , this is not always the case due to many factors 
. Marginally reduced combined inertial resistance , simplified exhaust plumbing , and the simultaneo
