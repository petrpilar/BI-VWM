he usual delay ( temporal miss ) between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a rep
opulation of the tumour cells . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the r
adiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumou
r cells . Furthermore , TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells , sug
gesting for the first time , a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) on tumour m
icroenvironment.The TARGIT techniqueThe machine used for TARGIT is Intrabeam ( Carl Zeiss , Germany 
) . It is a miniature and mobile X-ray source which emits low energy X-ray radiation ( max. 50 kV ) 
in isotropic distribution . Due to the higher ionization density caused by soft X-ray radiation in t
he tissue , the relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) of low-energy X-rays on gamma rays which a
