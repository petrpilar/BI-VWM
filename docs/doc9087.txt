s done by BAT-FLANN model by Sashikala Mishra , kailash shaw and Debahuti Mishra . A fuzzy bat clust
ering method has been developed to solve ergonomic workplace problems An interesting approach using 
fuzzy systems and bat algorithm has shown a reliable match between prediction and actual data for ex
ergy modelling . A detailed comparison of bat algorithm ( BA ) with genetic algorithm ( GA ) , PSO a
nd other methods for training feed forward neural networks concluded clearly that BA has advantages 
over other algorithms .ReferencesThe Fludyer Baronetcy , of London , was a title in the Baronetage o
