ases such as cancer . What nanoscientists will be able to achieve in the future is beyond current im
agination . This might be accomplished by self assembled biocompatible nanodevices that will detect 
, evaluate , treat and report to the clinical doctor automatically . Drug delivery systems , lipid- 
or polymer-based nanoparticles , can be designed to improve the pharmacological and therapeutic prop
erties of drugs . The strength of drug delivery systems is their ability to alter the pharmacokineti
cs and biodistribution of the drug . However , the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedi
cine is highly variable among different patients . When designed to avoid the body 's defence mechan
isms , nanoparticles have beneficial properties larger particles would have been cleared from the bo
dy , cells take up these nanoparticles because of their size . Complex drug delivery mechanisms are 
being developed , including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm
