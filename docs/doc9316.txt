.Climate Cloud albedo is a measure of the albedo of a cloud - higher values mean that the cloud refl
ects more solar radiation , or less radiation is transmitted . Cloud albedo varies from less than 10
% to more than 90% and depends on drop sizes , liquid water or ice content , thickness of the cloud 
, and the sun 's zenith angle . The smaller the drops and the greater the liquid water content , the
 greater the cloud albedo , if all other factors are the same . Low , thick clouds ( such as stratoc
umulus ) primarily reflect incoming solar radiation , causing it to have a high albedo , whereas hig
h , thin clouds ( such as Cirrus ) tend to transmit it to the surface but then trap outgoing infrare
d radiation , causing it to have low albedo . It contributes to the greenhouse effect . birthplace =
