ng that birds as big as P. sandersi can fly basically re-writes our idea of how big we think flying 
birds can get . P. sandersi covered the sky around 25 million to 28 million years ago and had paper-
thin hollow bones , stumpy legs and huge wings all indicators of flight . Researchers used a compute
r program to estimate big birds flight and capable of reaching speeds up to 40 mph . Live Science ex
plains : The model suggested the bird was an incredibly efficient glider , whose long , slender wing
s helped it stay aloft despite its enormous size . It was probably too big to take off simply by fla
pping its wings and launching itself into the air from a standstill instead , like Argentavis , P. s
andersi may have gotten off the ground by running downhill into a headwind or taking advantage of ai
r gusts to get aloft , much like a hang glider . Todays largest living flying bird is the royal alba
tross , which has a wingspan of about 3.5m . Thats a baby compared to P. sandersi . As for the previ
