 . From around the mid-15th century very tight-fitting doublets , belted or tailored to be tight at 
the waist , giving in effect a short skirt below , were fashionable , at least for the young . Sleev
es were generally full , even puffy , and when worn with a large chaperon , the look was extremely s
tylish , pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist , and a chun
ky , solid one above . The doublet was often elaborately pleated , especially at the back , the plea
ts being achieved by various means . In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high , tight and col
larless at the front of the neck sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back . Men of
 all classes wore shortbraiesor breeches , a loose undergarment , usually made of linen , which was 
held up by a belt . Hose or chausses made out of wool were used to cover the legs , and were general
ly brightly colored . Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots .
