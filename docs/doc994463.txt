with predictions of the synaptotropic hypothesis of dendritic branching .Dissenting EvidenceEvidence
 against the synaptotropic hypothesis comes from experiments with munc 18 knock-out mice , mice engi
neered to be missing the Munc 18-1 protein , without which the mice never release neurotransmitters 
from synaptic vesicles . Despite this , the mice develop normal brains before dying immediately afte
r birth .Imaging Techniques Dynamic MorphometricsDynamic morphometrics technology involves new metho
ds of labeling , imaging , and quantifying dendritogenesis . The transparent , externally developing
 vertebrate embryos ofXenopus laevisand zebrafish allow direct imaging of the organism in the critic
al stages of development while keeping the embryos intact . Individual brain neurons can be fluoresc
ently labeled using single cell electroporation while leaving the rest of the brain unaltered . Also
 , two-photon microscopy allows in vivo time-lapse imaging to create high-resolution , 3D images of
