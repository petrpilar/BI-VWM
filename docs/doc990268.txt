al failure of the glass envelope can occur . Flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in
 a glass tube . As the arc develops a supersonic shock-wave forms , traveling radially from the cent
er of the arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube . If the energy level is low enough , a soft 
tap against the glass is all that will be heard . However , if the energy level used equals the expl
osion energy rating of the lamp , the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass , rupturing the t
ube . The resulting explosion creates a loud , sonic shock-wave , and may throw shattered glass seve
ral feet . The explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface-area of the lamp t
he glass . Power loading is determined by the type and thickness of the glass , and the cooling meth
od that is used . Power loading is measured in watts per centimeter squared . However , since the pu
