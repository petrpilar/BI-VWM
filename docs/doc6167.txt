 is correct and should be delivered to the client . This feature enables other reliability features 
in the ADN , such as resending a request to a different server if the content returned by the origin
al server is found to be erroneous .Load balancing algorithmsThe load balancing algorithms found in 
today 's ADN are far more advanced than the simplistic round-robin and least connections algorithms 
used in the early 1990s . These algorithms were originally loosely based evolved to factor in condit
ions peculiar to networking and application environments . It is more accurate to describe today 's 
load balancing algorithms as application routing algorithms , as most ADN employ application awarene
ss to determine whether an application is available to respond to a request . This includes the abil
ity of the ADN to determine not only whether the application is available , but whether or not the a
pplication can respond to the request within specified parameters , often referred to as an service
