ble to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue . Tissue engineering makes use of artificially stimul
ated cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterial-based scaffolds and growth factors . For exam
ple , bones could be regrown on carbon nanotube scaffolds . Tissue engineering might replace today '
s conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants . Advanced forms of tissue e
ngineering may lead to life extension . Artificial bone composites are also being manufactured from 
nanocrystalline calcium phosphates.Antimicrobial effectsNanoparticles can be used in combination the
rapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties . It has been shown 
that Zinc Oxide nanoparticles can decrease the antibiotic in Vitro . Nanoparticles can interfere wit
