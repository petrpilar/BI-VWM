 in the atmosphere arise through the introduction of other non-natural , industrial materials .In na
tureMany marine organisms biosynthesize halomethanes , especially bromine-containing compounds . Sma
ll amounts of chloromethanes arise from the interaction of chlorine sources with various carbon comp
ounds . The biosyntheses of these halomethanes are catalyzed by the chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxi
dase enzymes , respectively . An idealized equation is : : CH 4 + Cl - + 1/2 O 2 CH 3 Cl + OH - Clas
ses of compoundsHalons are usually defined as hydrocarbons where the hydrogen atoms have been replac
ed by bromine , along with other halogens . They are ( but simpler than ) the system used for freons
