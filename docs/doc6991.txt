rsal process Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor or CD246 
( cluster of differentiation 246 ) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by theALKgene .FunctionALK
 plays an important role in the development of the brain and exerts its effects on specific neurons 
in the nervous system . The deduced amino acid sequences reveal that ALK is a novel receptor tyrosin
e kinase having a putative transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain . These sequences are ab
sent in the product of the transforming NPM-ALK gene . ALK shows the greatest sequence similarity to
 LTK ( leukocyte tyrosine kinase ) .PathologyThe ALK gene can be oncogenic in three ways by forming 
a fusion gene with any of several other genes , by gaining additional gene copies or with mutations 
of the actual DNA code for the gene itself .Anaplastic large-cell lymphomaThe 2 5 chromosomal transl
ocation is associated with approximately 60% anaplastic large-cell lymphomas ( ALCLs ) . The translo
