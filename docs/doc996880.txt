 electoral votes that go to the winner of the popular vote based on whichever candidate wins the pop
ular vote in each of Nebraska 's three congressional districts , all of which have trended Republica
n in the past elections . However Nebraska 's 2nd Congressional District , based in the city of Omah
a , is significantly less conservative . The second CD of Nebraska was actually considered as a batt
leground area by some , leading the Obama campaign to open a single campaign office in Omaha with 15
 staff members to cover the congressional district in September 2008 . More than 900 people attended
 the opening of those offices . Democratic Mayor Mike Fahey of Omaha said that he would do whatever 
it takes to deliver the electoral vote tied to the 2nd Congressional District to Obama , and the Oba
ma Campaign considered Nebraska 's 2nd congressional district in play . Former Democratic U.S. Senat
or Bob Kerrey and then senior U.S. Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama.AnalysisNebra
