 is a lunar crater that is located in the southwest part of the Moon . It lies to the southwest of t
he crater Cavendish and south of Mersenius . The rim of de Gasparis is worn and eroded , and the int
erior has been flooded by basaltic lava . The surviving outer rim reaches a maximum altitude of abou
t 0.8 km . This crater is notable for the formation of rilles that criss-cross the floor and the sur
rounding surface . This system of clefts in the surface is designated Rimae de Gasparis , and they s
pan an area of about 130 kilometers in diameter . The rilles are thought to have been created due to
 tectonic faults deep below the surface . As they cut across de Gasparis , this indicates that they 
were formed after the crater.Satellite cratersBy convention these features are identified on lunar m
