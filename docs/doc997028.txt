mation and that they could be very young , scientists are excited . Maybe the gullies are where we s
hould go to find life . There is evidence for all three theories . Most of the gully alcove heads oc
cur at the same level , just as one would expect of an aquifer . Various measurements and calculatio
ns show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin . One vari
ation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to
 flow in aquifers . Aquifers are layer that allow water to flow . They may consist of porous sandsto
ne . The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another terms it would be called impermeable ) . B
ecause water in an aquifer is prevented from going down , the only direction the trapped water can f
low is horizontally . Eventually , water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a 
breaklike a crater wall . The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies . Aquif
