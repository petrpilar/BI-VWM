exception is when the writer/speaker is being slightly emphatic , or even poetic , about a particula
r quality of an object ( rather than the mundane use of using the quality to specify which particula
r object they are referring to ) . Mi casa rojacould either mean that there are many red houses in t
he world but I wish to talk about the one that I happen to own , or that I have many houses but am r
eferring to the red one .Mi casa roja= My house , the red one . Mi roja casameans that I am stressin
g how red my particular house is ( probably the only house I have ) .Mi roja casa= My house , which 
is obviously red . In Spanish , adjectives agree with what they refer to in terms ) . For example ,t
aza( cup ) is feminine , so the red cup isla taza roj <u> a , butvaso( glass ) is masculine , so the
 red glass isel vaso roj <u> o . In Spanish , it is perfectly normal to let an adjective stand in fo
r a noun or pronounwith ( where people are involved ) no implication of condescension or rudeness .
