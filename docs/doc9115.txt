 would be maximized rather than minimized ) . Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised le
arning are in general estimation problems the applications include clustering , the estimation of st
atistical distributions , compression and filtering .Reinforcement learningusually not given , but g
enerated by an agent 's interactions with the environment . At each point in time scriptstyle t , th
e agent performs an action scriptstyle yt and the environment generates an observation scriptstyle x
t and an instantaneous cost scriptstyle ct , according to some ( usually unknown ) dynamics . The ai
m is to discover apolicyfor selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a long-term cost i.e. ,
 the expected cumulative cost . The environment 's dynamics and the long-term cost for each policy a
re usually unknown , but can be estimated . More formally the environment is modelled as a Markov de
cision process ( MDP ) with states scriptstyle s1 , ... , snin S and actions scriptstyle a1 , ... ,
