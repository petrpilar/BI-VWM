115 , obtained by nuclear collisions of lighter nuclei , are severely neutron-deficient , because th
e proportion of neutrons to protons needed for maximum stability increases with atomic number . The 
most stable isotope will probably be 299 Uup , with 184 neutrons , a known magic closed-shell number
 conferring exceptional stability , making it ( with one further proton outside the magic number of 
114 protons ) both the chemical and the nuclear homolog of 209 Bi but the technology required to add
 the required neutrons presently does not exist . This is because no known combination of target and
 projectile can result in the required neutrons . It has been suggested that such a neutron-rich iso
