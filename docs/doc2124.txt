orins are associated with eleven antigens of interest to transfusion medicine : the Gerbich ( Ge2 , 
Ge3 , Ge4 ) , the Yussef ( Yus ) , the Webb ( Wb or Ge5 ) , the Duch ( Dh(a) or Ge8 ) , the Leach , 
the Lewis II ( Ls(a) or Ge6 ) , the Ahonen ( An(a) or Ge7 ) and GEPL ( Ge10 ) , GEAT ( Ge11 ) and GE
TI ( Ge12 ) . Six are of high prevalence ( Ge2 , Ge3 , Ge4 , Ge10 , Ge11 , Ge12 ) and five of low pr
evalence ( Wb , Ls(a) , An(a) , Dh(a) and Ge9 ) .Gerbich antigenGlycophorin C and D encode the Gerbi
ch ( Ge ) antigens . There are four alleles , Ge-1 to Ge-4 . Three types of Ge antigen negativity ar
e known : Ge-1 , -2 , -3 ( Leach phenotype ) , Ge-2 , -3 and Ge-2 , +3 . A 3.4 because of unequal cr
ossing over between the two repeated domains , is responsible for the formation of the Ge-2 , -3 gen
otype . The breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3 and results in the deleti
on of exon 3 . This mutant gene is transcribed as a messenger RNA with a continuous open reading fra
