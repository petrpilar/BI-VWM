 the formation of the Cu-EDTA complex , and that for the formation of the Cu-amine complex . A catal
yzed endpoint procedure to determine trace amounts of metal ions in solution ( down to approximately
 10 mg/L ) employs 0.01 mol/L EDTA . This has been applied to the determination of low level Cu(II) 
in specialized plating baths , and to the determination of total hardness in water . The reaction en
thalpies of EDTA with most metal ions are often quite employed with commensurately high amounts of t
itrand in order to obtain sharp , reproducible endpoints . Using a catalytically indicated endpoint 
, very low EDTA titrant concentrations can be used . A back-titration is used . An excess of EDTA so
lution is added . The excess of EDTA is back-titrated with a suitable metal ion such as Mn 2+ or Cu 
2+ . At the endpoint , the first excess of metal ion catalyzes a strongly exothermic reaction betwee
n a polyhdric phenol ( such as resorcinol ) and hydrogen peroxide.Precipitation titrationsThermometr
