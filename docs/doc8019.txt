ers are quite common on Earth . A good example is Weeping Rock in Zion National Park Utah . As for t
he next theory , much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to 
be a mixture of ice and dust . This ice-rich mantle , a few yards thick , smoothes the land , but in
 places it has a bumpy texture , resembling the surface of a basketball . The mantle may be like a g
lacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the
 slopes and make gullies . Because there are few craters on this mantle , the mantle is relatively y
oung . An excellent view of this Crater Rim , as seen by HiRISE . The ice-rich mantle may be the res
ult of climate changes . Changes in Mars 's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribu
tion of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas . During certain climate 
periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere . The water comes back to ground at l
