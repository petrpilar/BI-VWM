 nanoparticles coated with tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , each about the size of a platelet 
, were injected intravenously . In the region of vessel narrowing , shear stresses dissociate the ag
gregates and release the tPA-coated nanoparticles which bind and degrade the blood clots . By prcise
d targeting and concentrating drug at the location of obstruction , the dose used is less than 1/50t
h of the normal dose . The nanotherapeutics will greatly reduce the severe side effect of bleeding ,
 commonly found in standard treatment of thrombosis . An early phase clinical trial using the platfo
rm of Minicell nanoparticle for drug delivery have been tested on patients with advanced and untreat
able cancer . Built from the membranes of mutant bacteria , the minicells were loaded with paclitaxe
l and coated with cetuximab , antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) whi
ch is often overexpressed in a number of cancers , as a ' homing ' device to the tumor cells . The t
