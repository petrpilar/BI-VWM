 plant pathogencauses root rot in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good in
dicator species for the presence of the disease . Most highly susceptible species quickly become loc
ally extinct in infected areas , and in the absence of hosts the disease itself eventually dies out 
. However ,B. sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground , often colonises
 old disease sites . The new colonies are themselves infected , and thusP. cinnamomisurvives at thes
e sites indefinitely . The application of phosphite inhibits growth ofP. cinnamomiinB. sessilis, but
 does not kill the pathogen . In one study , a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growt
h ofP. cinnamomiby over 90% in plants infected withB. sessilistwo weeks after spraying , and by 66% 
in plants infected one year after spraying yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying
 were dead 100 days later , while nearly all days . Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth ,
