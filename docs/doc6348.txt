 from many complex interactions , but it is believed to be the most important component of biomolecu
lar recognition in water . For example , Xu and Melcheret al .elucidated the structural basis for fo
lic acid recognition by folate acid receptor proteins . The strong interaction between folic acid an
d folate receptor was attributed to both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions . The study of 
non-covalent interactions is also used to study binding and cooperativity in supramolecular assembli
es and macrocyclic compounds such as crown ethers and cryptands , which can act as hosts to guest mo
lecules .Acid-base chemistryThe properties of acids and bases are relevant to physical organic chemi
stry . Organic chemists are primarily concerned with Brnsted-Lowry acids/bases as proton donors/acce
ptors and Lewis acids/bases as electron acceptors/donors in organic reactions . Chemists use a serie
