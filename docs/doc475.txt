hysical Review Cby a team composed of Russian scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research
 National Laboratory . The team reported that they bombarded americium-243 with calcium-48 ions to p
roduce four atoms of ununpentium . These atoms , they report , decayed by emission of alpha-particle
s to ununtrium in approximately 100 milliseconds. : + + 3 n + The DubnaLivermore collaboration has s
trengthened their claim for the discovery of ununpentium by conducting chemical experiments on the d
ecay daughter 268 Db . In experiments in June 2004 and December 2005 , the dubnium isotope was succe
ssfully identified by milking the Db fraction and measuring any SF activities . Both the half-life a
nd decay mode were confirmed for the proposed 268 Db which lends support to the assignment of Z=115
