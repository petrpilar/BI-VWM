larger geographical sphere of the region , ranging from the small sultanates like Asahan , Deli , La
ngkat and Serdang , to the powerful imperial sultanates like Brunei , Johor and Pattani . The emerge
nce of these sultanates resulted in a broader Malay cultural and commercial influence and the eventu
al expansion of the Malay world . The strong Malay cultural and linguistic diffusion in the region a
s observed by the European scholars during colonial era , would later became the basis for the const
ruction of several anthropological , geographical and linguistic terms . Among the examples are the 
concept of Malay race , the name Malay Archipelago for the region , and several linguistic terminolo
gies such as Malayo-Polynesian languages and Malayic languages . These xenisms have been very influe
ntial in shaping various modern views on the extent of the Malay world .See also Maphilindo Nusantar
