understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems . For example , current research
 in the excretory systems of mice organs based on their size and charge . These composites are encap
sulated by a dendrimer and assigned a specific charge and size . Positively-charged gold nanoparticl
es were found to enter the kidneys while negatively-charged gold nanoparticles remained in the liver
 and spleen . It is suggested that the positive surface charge of the nanoparticle decreases the rat
e of opsonization of nanoparticles in the liver , thus affecting the excretory pathway . Even at a r
elatively small size of 5 nm , though , these particles can become compartmentalized in the peripher
al tissues , and will therefore accumulate in the body over time . While advancement of research pro
ves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles , the dangers of nanotoxicity 
become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses . Nanoparticles are als
