 consortium , formed by FIAT ferroviaria , Ansaldo and other companies . The lines of the train were
 designed by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro . Group E.491 was designed to be used on freight tr
ains ( max speed 140km/h abbr=on ) while E.492 was designed for fast passenger trains ( max speed 16
0km/h abbr=on ) . They were intended to be used on the rail lines of Sardinia , at the time subject 
of future electrification . The project was later abandoned , but a lot of units had already been or
dered and built , and since the catenary on the mainland is mostly 3 kV DC ( except for high speed l
ines ) , and the locomotive was only able to run on 25 kV AC , tried to sell them to foreign railway
s ( France and Bulgaria ) , but never succeeded . In 2008 , the whole batch of 25 locomotives were s
old to Fruilexport , a company established in Ni ( Serbia ) . It seems thenceforth likely that they 
will be used on the Serbian 25 kV network . The Nuclear Fuel Factory ( FCN ) is located near Resende
