can be used to design molecules that possess enhanced reactivity . The physical processes which give
 rise to bond rotation barriers are complex , and these barriers have been extensively studied throu
gh experimental and theoretical methods . A number of recent articles have investigated the predomin
ance of the steric , electrostatic , and hyperconjugative contributions to rotational barriers in et
hane , butane , and more substituted molecules .Non-covalent interactionsChemists use the study of i
ntramolecular and intermolecular non-covalent bonding/interactions in molecules to evaluate reactivi
ty . Such interactions include , but are not limited to , hydrogen bonding , electrostatic interacti
ons between charged molecules , dipole-dipole interactions , polar- and bonding . In addition , the 
hydrophobic effectthe association of organic compounds in wateris an electrostatic , non-covalent in
