basins Permian post-collisional granitoids and intraplate igneous suites . Large-scale late Paleozoi
c shear zones follow the orogenic grain . There are many controversies about CAOB tectono-magmatic e
volution . One is the problem of juvenile versus recycled crust in the formation of CAOB igneous roc
ks . On one hand , the CAOB is considered to be the most important site of juvenile crust formation 
since the Neoproterozoic , because during its amalgamation magmatic units , massive amounts of grani
tic magmas were generated with juvenile Nd isotopic signatures ( Jahn , 2004 ) . However , recently 
obtained detrital and xenocrystic zircon ages confirmed an important role for older crust in the oro
gens evolution ( e.g. , Rino et al. , 2008 Safonova et al. , 2010 Rojas-Agramonte et al. , 2011 ) . 
The modest Neoproterozoic and huge early-middle Paleozoic zircon age spectra matche CAOB crustal gro
wth very well but older peaks of 1.8 Ga and 2.7 Ga suggest the involvement of older crust .Reference
