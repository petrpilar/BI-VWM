ended usefully .. the design editor in Design-Expert ( DX ) has long been a strong point , providing
 a central cockpit from which to intuitively refine and test most aspects , but various new control 
features have now been added to the package , small in themselves but significantly enhancing produc

 experimental designs . Minimum-run resolution IV ( MR4 ) factorial designs estimate all main effect
s , clear of two-factor or higher interactions , in a minimum of experimental runs . MR4 designs wor
k well for factor screening . Minimum-run resolution V ( MR5 ) factorial designs estimate all main e
ffects and two-factor interactions in a minimum of experimental runs . MR5 designs are typically don
e after screening to a vital few factors , which then need to be studied in more depth in case they 
interact . Whitcomb and Oehlert won the Shewell award in 2008 for invention of the half-normal plot
