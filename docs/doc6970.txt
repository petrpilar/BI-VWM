. Recent testing has shown that ultrasound can increase the effectiveness of cancer treatments such 
as chemotherapy and radiation therapy . This procedure is known as heat or hyperthermia therapy . By
 using the converted heat energy that ultrasound provides , specific diseased tissues can be heated 
often to temperatures around 41 to 45C . This increase in temperature has been linked to improved ef
fectiveness of cancer treatment due to dilation of blood vessels and increased oxygen presence in af
fected tissues . Another new treatment called HIFU ( High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ) takes advan
tage of the thermal energy characteristics of ultrasound . HIFU uses an ultrasound device that is ab
le to precisely focus ultrasound waves at a target tissue or specific group of cells . At the focus 
of this ultrasound energy , nearly spontaneous coagulative necrosis or cell death without harming ne
ighboring cells . This treatment greatly expands the ability of doctors to be able to destroy cancer
