e electron such as the hydrogen atom , H 2  + , H 3  2+ , etc. familiar atomic ( s , p , d , f ) and
 bonding ( , ) orbitals . In systems with multiple electrons , an overall multielectron wavefunction
 describes all of their properties at once . Such wavefunctions are generated through the linear add
ition of single electron wavefunctions to generate an initial guess , which is repeatedly modified u
ntil its associated energy is minimized . Thousands of guesses are often required until a satisfacto
ry solution is found , so such calculations are performed by powerful computers . Importantly , the 
solutions for atoms with multiple electrons give properties such as diameter and electronegativity w
