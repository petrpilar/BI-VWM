ry Commission ( NRC ) definesdepleted uraniumas uranium with a percentage of the 235 U isotope that 
is less than 0.711% by weight ( see ) . The military specifications designate that the DU used by th
e U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ) contain less than 0.3% 235 U ( AEPI , 1995 ) . In actuality , D
oD uses only DU that contains approximately 0.2% 235 U ( AEPI , 1995 ) . Depleted Uranium is also pr
oduced by recycling ' spent ' nuclear fuel , in which case it contains traces of Pu and Np and has t
herefore been called ' dirty DU ' although the quantities are so small that they are considered to b
e not of serious radiological significance ( even ) by ECRR.Uranium hexafluorideSome depleted uraniu
m produced is stored as uranium hexafluoride , a crystalline solid , ( D ) UF 6 , in steel cylinders
 Each cylinder holds up to 12.7 tonnes ( or 14 short tons ) of UF 6 . In the U.S. 560,000 tonnes of 
depleted UF 6 had accumulated by 1993 . In 2008 , 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were lo
