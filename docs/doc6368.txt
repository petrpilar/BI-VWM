 and is an important tool in improving the synthesis of a pure enantiomeric substance . It is also t
he only way to identify the position and bonding of elements that lack an NMR active nucleus such as
 oxygen . Indeed , before x-ray structural determination methods were made available in the early 20
th century all organic structures were entirely conjectural : tetrahedral carbon , for example , was
 only confirmed by the crystal structure of diamond , and the delocalized structure of benzene was c
onfirmed by the crystal structure of hexamethylbenzene . While crystallography provides organic chem
ists with highly satisfying data , it is not an everyday technique in organic chemistry because a pe
rfect single crystal of a target compound must be grown . Only complex molecules , for which NMR dat
a can not be unambiguously interpreted , require this technique . In the example below , the structu
re of the host-guest complex would have been quite difficult to solve without a single crystal struc
