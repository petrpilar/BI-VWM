 produced by the thermistor itself ( very minor influence ) . If the equilibrium for the reaction li
es far to the right ( i.e. a stoichiometric equilibrium has been achieved ) , then when all analyte 
has been reacted by the titrant continuing addition of titrant will be revealed by a sharp break in 
the temperature/volume curve . Figures 1a and 1b illustrate idealized examples . The shape of experi
mentally obtained thermometric titration plots will vary from such idealized examples , and some of 
the environmental influences listed above may . This can be due to insensitivity of the sensor or wh
ere thermal equilibrium at the endpoint is slow to occur . It can also occur where the reaction betw
een titrant and titrand does not proceed to stoichiometric completion . The determinant of the degre
e to which a reaction will proceed to completion is the free energy change . If this is favourable ,
 then the reaction will proceed to be completion and be essentially stoichiometric . In this case ,
