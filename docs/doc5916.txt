king proteins that act as channels across the cell membrane . These channels transport positively ch
arged potassium ions into and out of cells . In heart muscle , the ion channels produced from theKCN
E2,KCNJ2, andKCNQ1genes play critical roles in maintaining the heart 's normal rhythm . Mutations in
 these genes have been identified in only a few families worldwide . These mutations increase the ac
tivity of the channels , which changes the flow of potassium ions between cells . This disruption in
 the risk of syncope , stroke , and sudden death . Most cases of atrial fibrillation are not caused 
by mutations in a single gene . This condition is often related to structural abnormalities of the h
eart or underlying heart disease . Additional risk factors for atrial fibrillation include high bloo
d pressure ( hypertension ) , diabetes mellitus , a previous stroke , or an accumulation of fatty de
posits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) . Although most cases
