 of probes launched into heliocentric orbit for the purpose of studying solar processes . A joint ve
nture of the Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and NASA , the probes were launched from C
ape Canaveral Air Force Station , Florida , on Dec 10 , 1974 , and Jan 15 , 1976 , respectively . Th
e probes are notable for setting a maximum speed record among spacecraft at /h ( 157,078 mi/h or 43.
63 mi/s or /s or 0.000234c ) . The Helios space probes completed their primary missions by the early
 1980s , but they continued to send data up to 1985 . The probes are no longer functional but still 
remain in their elliptical orbit around the Sun .Viking program ( 1975 )The Viking program consisted
 of a pair of space probes sent to MarsViking 1 and Viking 2 . Each vehicle was composed of two main
 parts , an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit , and a lander designed to
 study the communication relays for the landers once they touched down . Viking 1 was launched on Au
