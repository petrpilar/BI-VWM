Babylonian astronomy took place during the time of the Seleucid Empire ( 32360 BC ) . In the 3rd cen
tury BC , astronomers began to use goal-year texts to predict the motions of the planets . These tex
ts compiled records of past observations to find the same time , or shortly afterwards , astronomers
 created mathematical models that allowed them to predict these phenomena directly , without consult
ing past records .Arithmetical predictionsThough there is a lack of surviving material on Babylonian
 planetary theory , it appears most of the Chaldean astronomers were concerned mainly with ephemerid
es and not with theory . Most of the predictive Babylonian planetary models that have survived were 
usually strictly empirical and arithmetical , and usually did not involve geometry , cosmology , or 
speculative philosophy like that of the later Hellenistic models , though the Babylonian astronomers
 were concerned with the philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe . In contras
