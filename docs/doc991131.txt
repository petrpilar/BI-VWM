 content is regulated by band 4.1 ( protein 4.1 ) . Additional data on the regulation of glycophorin
 C is . In a study of this gene among the Hominoidea two finding unique to humans emerged : ( 1 ) an
 excess of non-synonymous divergence among species that appears to be caused solely by accelerated e
volution and ( 2 ) the ability of the single GYPC gene to encode both the GPC and GPD proteins . The
 cause for this is not known but it was suggested that these findings might be the result of infecti

, B , C and D in order of the quantity present in the membrane - glycophorin A being the most and gl
ycophorin D the least common . A fifth ( glycophorin E ) has been identified within the human genome
 but can not easily be detected on routine gel staining . In total the glycophorins constitute 2% of
