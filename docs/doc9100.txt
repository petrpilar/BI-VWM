 of molecule . Clusters of the nanodiamonds in the range of 50-100 nm in diameter can be manufacture
d to trap drug inside and slowly release the payload . Experiments by researchers in Northwestern Un
iversity on mouse models with chemotherapy-resistant liver and breast cancers show that the nanodiam
onds with a normally lethal dose of doxorubicin significantly reduce the size of the tumors without 
toxic side effects expected from the drug if administered alone . The nanodiamond drug complex is fo

 Additional studies using nanodiamonds include treating the triple-negative breast cancer with epiru
bicin and glioblastoma with doxorubicin . Increase in survival rate with reduced side effects were o
bserved in both the mouse models . UCLA reported that contact lens embedded with nanodiamonds at the
 size of 5 nm in diameter and loaded with the glaucoma drug timolol maleate allow controlled and sus
