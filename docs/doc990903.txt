physical properties of the halomethanes are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the hal
ogen atoms . In general , they are volatile but less so than methane because of the polarizability o
f the halides . The polarizability of the halides and the polarity of the molecules makes flammable 
than methane . Broadly speaking , reactivity of the compounds is greatest for the iodides and lowest
 for the fluorides.Production Industrial routesThe halomethanes are produced on a massive scale from
 abundant precursors , i.e. natural gas or methanol , and from halogens or halides . They are usuall
y prepared by one of three methods . Free radical chlorination of methane : : CH 4 + Cl 2 ( + UV ) C
H 3 Cl + HCl This method is useful for the production of CH 4-x Cl x ( x = 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 ) . The 
main problems with this method are that it cogenerates HCl and it produces mixtures of different pro
ducts . Halogenation of methanol . This method is used for the production of the mono-chloride , -br
