is analysis compares the effect of various substituents on the ionization of benzoic acid with their
 impact on diverse chemical systems . The parameters of the Hammett plots are sigma ( ) and rho ( ) 
. The value of indicates the acidity of substituted benzoic acid relative to the unsubstituted form 
. A positive value indicates the compound is more acidic , while a negative value indicates that the
 substituted version is less acidic . The value is a measure of the sensitivity of the reaction to t
he change in substituent , but only measures inductive effects . Therefore , two new scales were pro
duced One is + , which concerns substituents that stabilize positive charges via resonance , and the
 other is - which is for groups that stabilize negative charges via resonance . Hammett analysis can
 be used to help elucidate the possible mechanisms of a reaction . For example , if it is predicted 
that the transition state structure has a build-up of negative charge relative to the ground state s
