ht isotopes of element 115 using the reaction 241 Am + 48 Ca . A team of researchers at Lund Univers
ity announced they had corroborated the 2004 findings in August 2013 by shooting calcium ions into a
 thin film of americium . Researchers at the GSI Helmholtz in Darmstadt , Germany reported the succe
ssful synthesis of ununpentium using the same reaction just two weeks later Target-projectile combin
ationsThe table below contains various combinations of targets and projectiles which could be used t
o form compound nuclei with Z=115 . Each entry is a combination for which calculations have provided
