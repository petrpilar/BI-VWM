1805 , Encke began to calculate the orbital elements of this comet . At this time , all the known co
mets had an orbital period of seventy years and more , with an aphelion far beyond the orbit of Uran
us . The most famous comet of this family was Comet Halley with its period of seventy-six years . So
 the orbit of the comet discovered by Pons have a period of 3.3 years , so that the aphelion had to 
be within the orbit of Jupiter . Encke predicted its return for 1822 , but this return was observabl
e only from the southern hemisphere and was seen by Carl Ludwig Christian Rmker in Australia . The c
omet was also identified with the one seen by Pierre Mchain in 1786 and by Caroline Herschel in 1795
 . Encke sent his calculations as a note to Gauss , Olbers , and Bessel . His former mathematics pro
fessor published this note and Encke became famous as the discoverer of the short periodic comets . 
The first object of this family , the Encke comet , was named after him and so it is one of the few
