erefore , the delivery of morphogens to EBs results in increased heterogeneity and decreased efficie
ncy of differentiated cell populations compared to monolayer cultures . One method of addressing tra
nsport limitations within EBs has been through polymeric delivery of morphogens from within the EB m
icrotissues and subsequently assembled into larger structures for tissue engineering applications . 
Although the complexity resulting from the three-dimensional adhesions and signaling may recapitulat
e more native tissue structures , it also creates challenges for understanding the relative contribu
tions of mechanical , chemical , and physical signals to the resulting cell phenotypes and morphogen
esis.Impact of ethics and policy on EB researchESCs are the subject of much public debate due to the
 ethical questions arising from the derivation from blastocyst-stage of development , necessitating 
the destruction of the embryo . Although much early EB research was conducted using ESCs derived fro
