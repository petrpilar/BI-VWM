umor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells engulf it . Once inside , the payload of 
anti-cancer drug kills the tumor cells . Measured at 400 nanometers , the minicell is bigger than sy
nthetic particles developed for drug delivery . The researchers indicated that this larger size give
s the minicells a better profile in side-effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out 
of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver , digestive system and
 skin . This Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patien
ts . As a platform technology , the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of d
ifferent cancers with different anti-cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side-effec
