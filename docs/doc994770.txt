ds ( FFA ) in edible fats and oils . Automated potentiometric titration procedures have been granted
 standard method status , for example by ASTM for TAN and AOAC for FFA . The methodology is similar 
in both instances . The sample is dissolved in a suitable solvent mixture say a hydrocarbon and an a
lcohol which also must intended to enhance the electrical conductivity of the solution . The trace a
cids are titrated with standard base in an alcohol . The sample environment is essentially hostile t
o the pH electrode used to sense the titration . The electrode must be taken out of service on a reg
ular basis to rehydrate the glass sensing membrane , which is also in danger of fouling by the oily 
sample solution . A recent thermometric titrimetric procedure for the determination of FFA developed
 by Cameiroet al .( 2002 ) has been shown to be particularly amenable to automation . It is fast , h
ighly precise , and results agree very well with those obtained by the official AOAC method . The te
