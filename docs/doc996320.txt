 ) . Often , with internal splines , the splined portion of the part may not have a through-hole , w

 tool into the area where the splines are machined . To prevent stress concentrations the ends of th

primary cause of failure in poorly designed splines. 5539 Limporyen ( 1965 UA1 ) is a main-belt aste
