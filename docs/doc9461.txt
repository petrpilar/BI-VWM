nd societys specificities.Characteristics of his workPlayful , humour and narrative poetry Two main 
recurring elements build up the artistic work of Djan Silveberg through the various forms of express
ions he uses : The narrative poetry , which comes from the literary world , is the expression of fee
lings through his works that can be tracked down as a kind of story-telling . The critical point of 
view of meaning and values . The quest for oneself and the other . This narrative poetry not only co
mes from words but also images and forms . A discrete , sometimes cutting or dark kind of humour is 
the second aspect of Djan Silvebergs artistic approach . Some of his works also play on words or sym
bols , with historical or literary references , amusing or rejection reactions , especially to trigg
er the will to come aboard his world .References Publications Quelques Vers de Rome MXMXCIV, Odes &a
