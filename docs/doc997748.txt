d also in galls and mines of other Tortricidae and Pyralidae species . Leo V is a dwarf spheroidal g
alaxy situated in the Leo constellation and discovered in 2007 in the data obtained by Sloan Digital
 Sky Survey . The galaxy is located at the distance of about 180 kpc from the Sun and moves away fro
m the Sun with the velocity of about 173 km/s . It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dSph
 ) meaning that it has an approximately spherical shape with the half-light radius of about 130 pc .
 Leo V is one of the smallest and fainest satellites of the Milky Wayits integrated luminosity is ab
out 10,000 times that of the Sun ( absolute visible magnitude of about ) , and the half-light radius
 of 40 pc. name=n1group=note which is much lower than the luminosity of a typical globular cluster .
 However , its mass is about 330 thousands solar masses , which means that Leo 's V mass to light ra
tio is around 75 . A relatively high mass to light ratio implies that Leo V is dominated by dark mat
