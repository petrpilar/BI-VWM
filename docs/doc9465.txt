the other cheek when confronted by violence :You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye and
 a tooth for a tooth . But I say to you , do not resist an evildoer . If anyone strikes you on the r

ent or destruction ' of the Hebrew law which the Church father St. Augustine already discussed in hi
s Contra Faustum , Book XIX . Dr Ian Guthridge cited many instances of genocide in the Old Testament
