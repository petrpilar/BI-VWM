terstate 95 , with the highway leaving its current alignment at Exit 40 ( Pennsylvania Route 413 ) a
nd following US 13 up to US 1 , where it would head north into Trenton by way of the Trenton-Morrisv

 expressway that would provide a direct connection between I-95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike ( Inte
rstate 276 ) . It would have run from Exit 40 of I-95 , intersect the PA Turnpike , and head to the 
southern end of the completed US 13 expressway in Tullytown . It was eventually cancelled due to fea
red environmental impacts on Silver Lake Park .Major intersectionsnotes=Delaware border notes= notes
