e describing authors in 1993 also concluded thatArchaeornithoideswas closely related to troodontids 
, Spinosauridae andLisboasaurus, all these taxa together with birds forming a clade , showing that b
irds originated from a more basal position than normally assumed . However , subsequent research has
 not supported a close relationship between spinosaurids and troodontids andLisboasauruswas later sh

Archaeornithoidesmay belong to a previously known species of Mongolian troodontid , eitherSaurornith
oidesorByronosaurus. However , studies of a juvenileByronosaurusskull showed that theropod dinosaurs
 possess many distinctive adult characteristics even characters solidly linkingArchaeornithoidesto k

nd no evidence to support the placement ofArchaeornithoidesclose to Avialae , and only weak support
