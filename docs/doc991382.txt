rials , such as agar or hydrophilic polymers , to promote the preferential adhesion between single c
ells , rather than to the culture substrate . As hESC undergo apoptosis when cultured as single cell
s , EB formation often necessitates the use of inhibitors of the rho associated kinase ( ROCK ) path
way , Thiazovivin/Tzv ) . Alternatively , to avoid dissociation into single cells , EBs can be forme
d from hESCs by manual separation of adherent colonies ( or regions of colonies ) and subsequently c
ultured in suspension . Formation of EBs in suspension is amenable to the formation of large quantit
ies of EBs , but provides little control over the size of the resulting aggregates , often leading t
o large , irregularly shaped EBs . As an alternative , the hydrodynamic forces imparted in mixed cul
ture platforms increase the homogeneity of EB sizes when ESCs are inoculated within bulk suspensions
 . Formation of EBs can also be more precisely controlled by the inoculation of known cell densities
