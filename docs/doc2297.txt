e country . They claimed responsibility for several attacks on the government in 2004. The columnar 
phase is a class of mesophases in which molecules assemble into cylindrical structures to act as mes
ogens . Originally , these kinds of liquid crystals were called discotic liquid crystals because the
 columnar structures are composed of flat-shaped discotic molecules stacked one-dimensionally . Sinc
e recent findings provide a number of columnar liquid crystals consisting of non-discoid mesogens , 
it is more common now to classify this state of matter and compounds with these properties as column
ar liquid crystals . Takuzo Aida and co-workers recently reported cyclic peptides that self-assemble
 into polar columnar organizations . These materials can be unidirectionally aligned over large area
s by application of an external electric field .ClassesColumnar liquid crystals are grouped by their
 structural order and the ways of packing of the columns . Nematic columnar liquid crystals have no
