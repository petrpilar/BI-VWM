t design . The first design to be produced in their newly set-up MOS fab in Worcester , was the MK10
01 , a simple shifter chip . This was followed by a 1k PMOS aluminum-gate DRAM , the MK4006 that was
 manufactured in their Carrollton facility . Mostek had been working with Sprague Electric to develo
p the ion implantation process which provided a tremendous gain in the control of doping profiles . 
Using ion implantation , Mostek became an early leader in MOS manufacturing technology , while their
 competition was still mostly using the older bipolar technology . The resulting increased speed and
 lower cost of the MK4006 memory chip made it the runaway favorite to IBM and other mainframe and mi
nicomputer manufacturers ( cf. BUNCH , Digital Equipment Corporation ) . In 1970 Busicom , a Japanes
e adding machine manufacturer , approached Intel and Mostek with a proposal to introduce a new elect
ronic calculator line . Intel responded first , providing them with the Intel 4004 , which they used
