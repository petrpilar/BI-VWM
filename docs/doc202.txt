h the different proteins which are interacting in the antibiotic resistance or pharmacologic mechani
sms of drugs . Another example is Silver which has been used for the treatment of burns and chronic 
wounds . Antibacterial and antifungal properties of nanoparticles have widened their applications in
 medicine and dentistry.Immune responseBuckyballs have been investigated for the ability to interrup
t the allergy/immune response by preventing mast cells ( which cause allergic response ) from releas
ing histamine into the blood and tissues , by binding to free radicals dramatically better than any 
anti-oxidant currently available , such as vitamin E . In February 2013 , University of Pennsylvania
 researchers developed a way to prevent nano particles from triggering an immune system response whi
ch could aid the delivery of medicinal nanoparticles some time in future . This is done by using the
 protein CD47 , found on most mammalian cell membranes which binds to the SIRPa in macrophages preve
