ecember 7 , 1995 , a little more than six years later , via gravitational assist flybys of Venus and
 Earth . Despite antenna problems , Galileo conducted the first asteroid flyby , discovered the firs

 planet 's extensive magnetosphere . The orbits were designed for close up flybys of Jupiter 's larg
est moons . Once Galileo 's prime mission was concluded , an extended mission followed starting on D
