regular bushfire . MostBanksiaspecies can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their re

 buds protected by thick bark reseedersare killed by fire , but populations are rapidly re-establish

eseeders in not being strongly serotinous : the vast majority of seeds are released spontaneously in
 autumn , even in the absence of fire . The degree of serotiny is a matter of some contradiction in 
the scientific literature : it has been treated as serotinous , weakly serotinous and non-serotinous
 . Regardless of the terminology used , the massive spontaneous seed output ofB. sessilisis its prim
