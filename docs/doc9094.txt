se of the toxic paclitaxel. Researchers at Case Western Reserve University reported using nanopartic
le chain to deliver doxorubicin to breast cancer cells in a mice study . Three magnetic , iron-oxide
 nanospheres were chemically linked to one doxorubicin-loaded liposome and formed a 100 nm long nano
particle chain . After the nanochains penetrated the tumor , radiofrequency field was generated that
 caused the magnetic nanoparticles to vibrate and rupture the liposome , dispersing the drug in its 
free form throughout the tumor . The result showed that the nano treatment was more effective in hal
ting tumor growth than the standard treatment with doxorubicin . It is also less harmful to healthy 
cells since only 5% to 10% of the standard dose ( PEG ) carrying payload of antibiotics at its core 
could swift charge thus allowing them to target bacterial infection more precisely inside the body ,
 a group of MIT researchers reported . The nanoparticles , containing a sub-layer of pH sensitive ch
