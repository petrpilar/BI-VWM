tions of fluoride ( including hydrofluoric acid ) can be determined by a simple thermometric titrati
on with boric acid . : B(OH) 3 + 3F  + 3H + BF 3 + 3H 2 O The titration plot illustrated in Figure 1
9 shows that the endpoint is quite rounded , suggesting that the reaction might not proceed to stoic
hiometric equilibrium . However , since the regions of the temperature curve immediately before and 
after the endpoint are quite linear , the second derivative of this curve ( representing the interse
ction of tangents ) will accurately locate the endpoint . Indeed , excellent precision can be obtain
ed with this titration , with a CV of less than 0.1.Determination of formaldehydeFormaldehyde can be
 determined in electroless copper plating solutions and titrating the liberated hydroxyl ion with st
