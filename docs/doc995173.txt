traffic to a pool , also known as a cluster or farm , of servers . The application delivery controll
er ( ADC ) is assigned a single virtual IP address ( VIP ) that represents the pool of servers . Tra
ffic arriving at the ADC is then directed to one of the servers in the pool ( cluster , farm ) based
 on a number of factors including application specific data values , application transport protocol 
, availability of servers , current performance metrics , and client-specific parameters . An ADN pr
ovides the advantages of load distribution , increase in capacity of servers , improved scalability 
, security , and increased reliability through application specific health checks . Increasingly the
 ADN comprises a redundant pair of ADC on which is integrated a number of different feature sets des
igned to provide security , availability , reliability , and acceleration functions . In some cases 
these devices are still separate entities , deployed together delivered , each providing specific fu
