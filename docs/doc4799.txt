s . In winter 2002 he wroteThe Taqwacores, which told the story of a fictitious group of Muslim punk
-rockers living in Buffalo , New York . Characters included a Straight edge Sunni Muslim , drunken m
ohawk-wearing Sufi punk , burqa-wearing riot grrrl and Shi'a skinhead . Knight originally self-publi

icked up for distribution by Alternative Tentacles , the punk record label founded by Jello Biafra .
 An encounter with Peter Lamborn Wilson led toThe Taqwacoresbeing published by Autonomedia in 2004 .
The Taqwacoreswas intended as Knight 's farewell to Islam , but encouragement from readers caused Kn

al taqwacore scene , including bands such as the Kominas , Vote Hezbollah , and Secret Trial Five .
