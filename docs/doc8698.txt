ated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue , as it reduces the
 chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back , it most commonly occurs in 
the tissues surrounding the original cancer ( the tumour bed ) , even though there are multicentric 
cancers in remote areas of the breast . This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour 
bed . The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed . 
Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) following surgical rem
oval of the tumor have been time tested and proven to be effective . EBRT is usually given as a cour
