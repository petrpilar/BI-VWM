on the southern bank of the Tees . The bridge was built with sufficient clearance to allow ships to 
pass , although the port of Stockton-on-Tees up-river was virtually redundant by then . Since the Te
es Newport Bridge had its lifting deck permanently fixed in the down position in 1990 , large shippi
ng can no longer reach the Tees viaduct , further reducing the need for such a high structure . The 
bridge was constructed from 1973 to 1975 and opened in 1975 . It is made of reinforced concrete pile
s , steel-plate girders and a composite deck and is the largest such bridge in the British bridge wa
s opened and repairs have been necessary at times . Expansion joints were cracking and allowing de-i
cing salts to wash from the bridge carriageway into the piers , cross beams and columns giving rise 
to extensive chloride attack and it was decided the best solution was the complete demolition and re
construction of most of the piers and repair of others . The bridge now carries some 70,000 vehicles
