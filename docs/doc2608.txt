 be expressed . The DNA segments can be combined by using a variety of methods , such as restriction
 enzyme/ligase cloning or Gibson assembly . In standard cloning protocols , the cloning of any DNA f
ragment essentially involves seven steps : ( 1 ) Choice of host organism and cloning vector , ( 2 ) 
Preparation of vector DNA , ( 3 ) Preparation of DNA to be cloned , ( 4 ) Creation of recombinant DN
A , ( 5 ) Introduction of recombinant DNA into containing recombinant DNA , and ( 7 ) Screening for 
clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties .These steps are described in some detail 
in a related article ( molecular cloning ) . Expression of recombinant DNAFollowing transplantation 
into the host organism , the foreign DNA contained within the recombinant DNA construct may or may n
ot be expressed . That is , the DNA may simply be replicated without expression , or it may be trans
cribed and translated so that a recombinant protein is produced . Generally speaking , expression of
