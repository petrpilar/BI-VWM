or the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar ( anti-roll bar ) , Corvairs required tire pressu
res which were outside of the tire manufacturer 's recommended tolerances . The Corvair relied on an
 unusually high front to rear pressure differential ( 15psi front , 26psi rear , when cold 18 psi an

at the time , the result was a dangerous oversteer . Despite the fact that proper tire pressures was
