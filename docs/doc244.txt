llucinations do not affect their reality perception . Hence they are not considered psychotic . Psyc
hosis has been traditionally linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine . In particular , the dopamine 
hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and in the brain , particularly in the mesolimbic pathw
ay . The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 bl
ocking drugs ( i.e. , antipsychotics ) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms , and that
 drugs that boost dopamine activity ( such as amphetamines and cocaine ) can trigger psychosis in so

to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate , in particular , with the acti
