d its fragments , the distribution of isotopic variant masses can also be determined and the qualita
tive presence of certain elements identified due to their characteristic natural isotope distributio
n . The ratio of fragment mass population to the parent ion population can be compared against a lib
rary of empirical fragmentation data and matched to a known molecular structure . Combined gas chrom
atography and mass spectrometry is used to qualitatively identify molecules and quantitatively measu
re concentration with great precision and accuracy , and is widely used to test for small quantities
 of biomolecules and illicit narcotics in blood samples . For synthetic organic chemists it is a use
ful tool for the characterization of new compounds and reaction products .CrystallographyUnlike spec
troscopic methods , X-ray crystallography always allows lengths totally unavailable through spectros
copy . It is often used in physical organic chemistry to provide an absolute molecular configuration
