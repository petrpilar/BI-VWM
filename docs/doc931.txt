itude 6.5 to 7.3 ) . The Charleston quake was particularly surprising had almost no history of even 
minor earthquakes . In 2001 , a large intraplate earthquake devastated the region of Gujarat , India
 . The earthquake occurred far from any plate boundaries , which meant the region above the epicente
r was unprepared for earthquakes . In particular , the Kutch district suffered tremendous damage , w
here the death toll was over 12,000.CausesMany cities live with the seismic risk of a rare , large i
ntraplate earthquake . The cause of these earthquakes is often uncertain . In many cases , the causa
tive fault is deeply buried , and sometimes can not even be found . Under these circumstances it is 
difficult to calculate the exact seismic hazard for a given city , especially if there was only one 
earthquake in historical times . Some progress is being made in understanding the fault mechanics dr
iving these earthquakes .PredictionScientists continue to search for the causes of these earthquakes
