ferencesDepleted uranium ( DU also referred to in the past as Q-metal , depletalloy or D-38 ) is ura
nium with a lower content of the fissile isotope U-235 than natural uranium . : Depleted uranium pos
sesses only 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium , having been ' depleted ' of much of its mo
st highly radioactive U 234 and U 235 isotopes . ( Natural uranium is about 0.72% U-235the fissile i
sotope , and the DU used by the U.S. Department of Defense contain less than 0.3% U-235 ) . Uses of 
DU take advantage of its very high density of 19.1 g/cm 3 ( 68.4% denser than lead ) . Civilian uses
 include counterweights in aircraft , radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy and industria
