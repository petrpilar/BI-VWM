ing , he yelps Work ? ! and jumps with fear or even faints . He serves as a foil to the well-groomed
 , well-dressed , straight-laced Dobie , and the contrast between the two friends provides much of t
he humor of the series . By the third season ofDobie Gillis, Maynard becomes less of the stereotypic
al beatnik and more a free soul who does his own thing , as he might sayincluding collecting tinfoil
 or down and going to see the movieThe Monster That Devoured Cleveland, which perpetually ran at the
 Central City Bijou throughout the entire series run . In one episode , he invites Dobie to accompan
y him to a double-feature of the film and its sequel ,Son of the Monster that Devoured Cleveland. Ma
ynard may be described as the prototype of the late-1960s hippie . Many of the later episodes center
 around Maynard , with Dobie more of an observer , but always as narrator . The series lasted four y
ears , but its popularity extended into the 1990s and 2000s as channels like Nick at Nite and Me-TV
