 he was barely over 19 , he became an aeronautical research scientist at the National Advisory Commi
ttee for Aeronautics ( NACA , forerunner to NASA ) at Langley Field , Virginia . He took an educatio
nal leave from NACA to enroll in 1947 in the graduate program in Applied Mathematics at Brown Univer
sity , completing his Ph.D . in 1950 . He returned to Langley in 1950 and , in 1952 , was appointed 
Head of the Structural Mechanics Branch . He joined the faculty of Harvard in 1955 . He made widely 
cited contributions on the way that fissures and joints in rocks affect the propagation of seismic w
aves , in the Earth , and contributed to understanding stressing and deformation in the inflation of
 the human lung . His work of the later years was focused on problems in the domain of materials sci
ence , explaining mechanical properties of solids in terms of microscopic mechanisms . He referred t
o this important area as micromechanics . He was one of its pioneers , and contributed to explanatio
