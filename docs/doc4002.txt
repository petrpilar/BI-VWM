 vibrate , and consequently can be at non-zero temperatures .Principles of energeticsAs a general st
atement of energy flows under transformation , the principles of energetics include the first four l
aws of thermodynamics which seek a rigorous description . However the precise place of the laws of t
hermodynamics within the principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate . If the ecologi
st Howard T. into consideration a hierarchical ordering of energy forms , which aims to account for 
the concept of energy quality , and the evolution of the universe . Albert Lehninger ( 1973 , p. 2 )
 called these hierarchical orderings the Odum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one coroll
ary that take energy hierarchy into account . The first four principles of energetics are related to
 the same numbered laws of thermodynamics , and are expanded upon in that article . The final four p
rinciples are taken from the ecological energetics of H.T. Odum. Zeroth principle of energetics : If
