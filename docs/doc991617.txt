boratory process used to create recombinant DNA . It is one of two widely used methods ( along with 
polymerase chain reaction , abbr . PCR ) used to direct the replication of any specific DNA sequence
 chosen by the experimentalist . The fundamental difference between the two methods is that molecula
r cloning involves replication of the DNA within a living cell , while PCR replicates DNA Formation 
of recombinant DNA requires a cloning vector , a DNA molecule that replicates within a living cell .
 Vectors are generally derived from plasmids or viruses , and represent relatively small segments of
 DNA that contain necessary genetic signals for replication , as well as additional elements for con
venience in inserting foreign DNA , identifying cells that contain recombinant DNA , and , where app
ropriate , expressing the foreign DNA . The choice of vector for molecular cloning depends on the ch
oice of host organism , the size of the DNA to be cloned , and whether and how the foreign DNA is to
