. Therefore , because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance , the transformer , triggering 
circuit , and silicon controlled rectifier ( SCR ) must be able to handle very high peak currents , 
often in excess of 1500 amps.Simmer voltage triggeringSimmer voltage triggering is the least common 
method . In this technique , the capacitor voltage is not initially applied to the electrodes , but 
instead , a high voltage spark streamer is maintained between the electrodes . The high current from
 the capacitor is delivered to the electrodes using a thyristor or a spark gap . This type of trigge
ring is used mainly in very fast rise time systems , typically those that discharge in the microseco
nd regime , such as used in high speed stop-motion photography or dye lasers . The simmering spark s
treamer causes the arc to develop in the exact center of the lamp , increasing the lifetime dramatic
ally . If external triggering is used , the spark streamers may still be in through the tube , causi
