ght at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets . Appleton found in fact that it 
increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to
 record . This variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the suns influence 
. At sunset , the intensity of the suns radiation will be much less at the surface of the earth than
 it is high up in the atmosphere . This means ionic recombination will progress slowly from lower al
titudes to higher ones and therefore the height at which waves are reflected slowly increases as the
 sun sets . The basic idea behind Appletons work is so simple that it is hard to understand at first
 how he devoted almost all of the last couple of paragraphs some of the complexities of the subject 
have been introduced . Like many other fields , it is one that grows in intricacy the more it is stu
