ame virtually ( and even formally acknowledged in occasions ) independent rulers ( mtavari ) of the 
Principality of Guria in the mid-16th century , but were forced to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire
 , nominally recognizing also the authority of the princes of Mingrelia and kings of Imereti . Throu

cts with the neighboring Georgian rulers , Ottoman inroads , and repeated occasions of civil strife
