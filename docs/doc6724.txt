amma-ray bursts have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the Milky Way upon the emergence of
 complex life in its habitable zone . It is proposed as an explanation of Fermi 's paradox since it 
provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of intelligent beings in
 the local galaxy nearby to Earth . This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected 
by humans .The problemIt is estimated that Earth-like planets in the Milky Way started forming 9 Gya
 BP , and that their median age is 6.4 0.7 Gya . Moreover , 75% of stars in the galactic habitable z

life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ( 4.54 Gya ) . This creates an observat
