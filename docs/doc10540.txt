o form in PsbZ-deficient mutants , providing further evidence to suggest Ycf9 's role as a structura
l linker . This may be caused by a marked decrease in two LHCII antenna proteins , CP26 and CP29 , f
ound in PsbZ-deficient mutants , which result in structural changes , as well as functional modifica
tions in PSII.FunctionPSII is a multisubunit protein-pigment complex containing polypeptides bound t
o the photosynthetic membrane . Within the core of the complex , the chlorophyll and beta-carotene p
igments are mainly bound to the antenna proteins CP43 ( PsbC ) and CP47 ( PsbB ) , which pass the ex
citation energy on ) and D2 ( Qa , PsbD ) that bind all the redox-active cofactors involved in the e
nergy conversion process . The PSII oxygen-evolving complex ( OEC ) oxidises water to provide proton
s for use by PSI , and consists of OEE1 ( PsbO ) , OEE2 ( PsbP ) and OEE3 ( PsbQ ) . The remaining s
ubunits in PSII are of low molecular weight ( less than 10 kDa ) , and are involved in PSII assembly
