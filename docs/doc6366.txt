ure is therefore helpful in explaining electronic excitations , and through careful control of molec
ular structure it is possible to tune the HOMO-LUMO gap to give desired colors and excited state pro
perties .Mass spectrometryMass spectrometry is a technique which allows for the measurement of molec
ular mass and offers complementary data to spectroscopic techniques for structural identification . 
In a typical experiment a gas phase sample of an organic material is ionized and the resulting ionic
 species are accelerated by an applied electric field into a magnetic field . The deflection imparte
