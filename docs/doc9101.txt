tained release of the medicine . The nanodiamonds were combined with the polymer chitosan which is c
leaved when the lens make contact with the lysozyme in tears . The drug releases slowly in the eyes 
when the nanodiamond structure breaks down . In regenerative medicine research , silica based nanopa
rticles are used to deliver molecules to transplanted cells derived from stem cells . Using a mouse 
model , scientists delivered two synthetic versions of neurotrophic growth factors locally using mes
oporous nanoparticles to motor neurons derived from transplanted embryonic stem cells and reported i
mproved long term survival and functional differentiation of the transplantin vivo. Nanoparticle wit
