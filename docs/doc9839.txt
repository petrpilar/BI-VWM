te boundary . Intraplate earthquakes are relatively rare . Interplate earthquakes , which occur at p
late boundaries , are more common . Nonetheless , very large intraplate earthquakes can inflict heav
y damage , particularly because such areas are not accustomed to earthquakes and buildings are usual
ly not seismically retrofitted . Examples of damaging intraplate earthquakes are the devastating Guj
arat earthquake in 2001 , the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes , the 1811-1812 earthquakes in New Madri

latesThe surface of the Earth is made up of seven primary and eight secondary tectonic plates , plus
 dozens of tertiary microplates . The large plates move very slowly , owing to convection currents w
ithin the mantle below the crust . Because they do not all move in the same direction , plates often
 directly collide or move laterally along each other , a tectonic environment that environments most
