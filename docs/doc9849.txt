.Terminology in the United StatesIn the United States , bathrooms are generally categorized as maste
r bathroom , containing a shower and a tub that is adjoining to a master bedroom , a full bathroom (
 or full bath ) , containing four plumbing fixtures : bathtub , shower , toilet , and sink half ( 1/
2 ) bath ( or powder room ) containing just a toilet and sink and 3/4 bath containing toilet , sink 
, and shower , although the terms vary from market , sink , and shower are considered a full bath . 
This lack of a single , universal definition commonly results in discrepancies between advertised an
d actual number of baths in real estate listings . An additional complication is that there are curr
ently two ways of notating the number of bathrooms in a dwelling . One method is to count a half bat
hroom as .5 and then add this to the number of full bathrooms ( e.g. , 2.5 baths would mean 2 full b
aths and 1 half bath ) . The other , newer method is to put the number of full bathrooms to the left
