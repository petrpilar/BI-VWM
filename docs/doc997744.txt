 surface . When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface , the balls would be forced 
up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy . This made for light
er braking pressure than with calipers , avoided brake fade , promoted cooler running and provided o
ne-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums . But because of the expense
 , the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown Imperial through 1954 and the Town and Countr
y Newport other Chryslers , priced around $400 , at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed 
for $935 . Today 's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful , but admit its gra
