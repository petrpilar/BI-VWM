ife . Edel did treat James 's relationships with novelist Constance Fenimore Woolson and sculptor He
ndrik Christian Andersen at length , especially in volumes three and four of the biography . After w
eighing all the evidence , Edel confessed that he was unable to decide whether James experienced a c
onsummated sexual relationship . Although later scholarship and new materials have called into quest
ion the accuracy of his portrait of James , Edel 's work remains an important source for studies of 
the author . :A biography seems irrelevant if it does n't discover the overlap between what the indi
vidual did and the life that made this possible . Without discovering that , you have shapeless happ
enings and gossip .-- Leon EdelSelected bibliographyHenry James : The Untried Years 1843&ampndash 18
