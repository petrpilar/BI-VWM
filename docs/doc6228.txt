er the synthesis of quinine , a potent drug , discovered a process that obtained a purple dye ( whic
h he called mauveine ) from aniline , which in turn could be easily obtained from coal tar over the 
next ten years Perkin set up the first industrial model of molecules obtained through research from 
numerous teams all over Europe on coal tar by-products , while he himself pursued such a work on top
 of his industrial activity . Thus it came that in 1868 , in turn alizarin was proved to be obtainab
le from anthracene , in parallel by Perkin and by Carl Grbe and Carl Theodore Liebermann , both work
ing in Germany for the BASF company unfortunately Perkin missed the patent priority by one single da
y , alizarin 's extraordinary properties made it become the first really mass industry-produced dye 
and enabled the rise of BASF to first rank in the chemistry industry world .Discovery and industrial
