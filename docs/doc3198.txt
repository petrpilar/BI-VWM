Sylvester matrix is a matrix associated to two univariate polynomials with coefficients in a field o
r a commutative ring . The entries of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials are coefficients of th
e polynomials . The determinant of the Sylvester matrix of two polynomials is their resultant , whic
h is zero when the two polynomials have a common root ( in case of coefficients in a field ) or a no
n-constant common divisor ( in case of coefficients in an integral domain ) . Sylvester matrix is na
