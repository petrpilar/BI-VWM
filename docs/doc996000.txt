 , monotremes , and even basal eutherians ( the ancestors of placental mammals ) . In modern marsupi
als the epipubic bones are often called marsupial bones because they support the mother 's pouch (ma
rsupiumis Latin for pouch ) , but their presence on other groups of mammals indicates that this was 
not their original function , which some researchers think was to assist locomotion by supporting so
me of the muscles that flex the thigh . The epipubic bones were first described in 1698 but their fu
nctions have remained unresolved . It has been suggested that they form part of a kinetic linkage st
retching from the femur on one side to the ribs on the opposite side . This linkage is formed by a s
eries of muscles : each epipubic bone is connected to the femur by the pectineus muscle , and to the
 ribs and vertebrae by the pyramidalis , rectus abdominis , and external and internal obliques . lev
ers to stiffen the trunk during locomotion.See also Evolution of mammals Obturator process Proximodo
