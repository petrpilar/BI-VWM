a virtual IP address ( VIP ) and position of the ADN in the network provides the means through which
 certain resources can be cloaked , or hidden , from the client . Because the ADN is designed to und
erstand applications and application protocols , such as HTTP , it can manipulate certain aspects of
 the protocol to cloak the servers in the pool and prevent potentially useful information regarding 
the software and hardware infrastructure from being exposed . A typical use of this functionality is
 to hide the operating system and server software used to host the application . This is usually acc
omplished by rewriting the Server field in an HTTP response . A second typical use of this functiona
