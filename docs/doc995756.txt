ructions exist , while there are no such instructions for SATD . However , SATD can still be optimiz
ed considerably with SIMD instructions on most modern CPUs . The benefit of SATD is that it more acc
urately predicts quality from both the standpoint of objective and subjective metrics . As such , it
 is to drive and estimate distortion explicitly , such as in the Theora ( since 1.1 alpha2 ) encoder
 , as an optional metric used in wide motion searches , such as in the Microsoft VC-1 encoder , or a
s a metric used in sub-pixel refinement , such as in x264. Michael Davison may refer to : Michael S.
