 detect , image , and then proceed to treat a tumor is under way . A promising new cancer treatment 
that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials . Kanzius RF th

 ) cells . Sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires , able to detect proteins and other b
iomarkers left behind by cancer cells , could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the ea
rly stages from a few drops of a patient 's blood . The basic point to use drug delivery is based up
on three facts : a ) efficient encapsulation of the drugs , b ) successful delivery of said drugs to
 the targeted region of the body , and c ) successful release of that drug there . Researchers at Ri
