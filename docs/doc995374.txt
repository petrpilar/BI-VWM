in difficult to reach environments ( high pressure , high temperature , gas phase , phase boundaries
 ) . Molecular vibrations are quantized in an analogous manner to electronic wavefunctions , with in
teger increases in energy between vibrational states is nearly constant , often falling in the energ
y range corresponding to infrared photons , because at normal temperatures molecular vibrations clos
ely resemble harmonic oscillators . It allows for the crude identification of functional groups in o
rganic molecules , but spectra are complicated by vibrational coupling between nearby functional gro
ups in complex molecules . Therefore , its utility in structure determination is usually limited to 
simple molecules . Further complicating matters is that some vibrations do not induce a change in th
e molecular dipole moment and will not be observable with standard IR absorption spectroscopy . Thes
e can instead be probed through Raman spectroscopy , but this technique requires a more elaborate ap
