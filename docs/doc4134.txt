inished product . The amount of air alters the taste of the finished product . Product with low quan
tities of air has a heavy , icy taste and appears more yellow . Product with higher air content tast
es creamier , smoother and lighter and appears whiter . The optimum quantity of air is determined by
 the other ingredients and individual taste . It is generally accepted that the ideal air content sh
ould be between 33% and 45% of volume . More than this and the product loses taste , tends to shrink
 as it loses air and melts more quickly than that with less air . All ice cream must be frozen quick

 the draw valve , fresh mix combined with the targeted quantity of air is introduced to the freezing
 chamber either by gravity or pump . It is then churned and quick frozen and stored until required .
