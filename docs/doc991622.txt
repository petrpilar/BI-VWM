 technology is important to most current work in the biological and biomedical sciences . Recombinan
t DNA is used to identify , map and sequence genes , and to determine their function . rDNA probes a
re employed in analyzing gene expression within individual cells , and throughout the tissues of who
le organisms . Recombinant proteins are widely used as reagents in laboratory experiments and to gen
erate antibody probes for examining protein synthesis within cells and organisms . Many additional p
ractical applications of recombinant DNA are found in industry , food production , human and veterin
ary medicine , agriculture , and bioengineering . Some specific examples are identified below . Reco
mbinant chymosin found in rennet , is an enzyme required to manufacture cheese . It was the first ge
netically engineered food additive used commercially . Traditionally , processors obtained chymosin 
from rennet , a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk-fed calves . Scientists engineer
