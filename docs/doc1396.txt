c Conference of 1943 Lord Mountbatten brought a block of pykrete along to demonstrate its potential 
to the bevy of admirals and generals who had come along with Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roose
velt . Mountbatten entered the project meeting with two blocks and placed them on the ground . One w
as a normal ice block and the other was pykrete . He then drew his service pistol and shot at the fi
rst block . It shattered and splintered . Next , he fired at the pykrete to give an idea of the resi
stance of that kind of ice to projectiles . The bullet ricocheted off the block , grazing the trouse
r leg of Admiral Ernest King and ended up in the wall . Sir Alan Brooke 's diaries support this acco
unt , telling how Mountbatten brought two blocks first shooting at the ice , with a warning to bewar
e of splinters , Mountbatten saidI shall fire at the block on the right to show you the difference. 
Brooke reports , the bullet rebounded out of the block and buzzed round our legs like an angry bee .
