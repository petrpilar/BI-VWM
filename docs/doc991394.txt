ed polarisation ( SIP ) or Complex resistivity is a geophysical survey technique and an extension of
 the induced polarisation ( IP ) method , being itself an extension of measuring the Earth 's resist
ance at a single frequency or under direct current ( a technique commonly known by the name resistiv
ity ) . SIP measures the frequency-dependent ( i.e. spectral ) complex impedance , equivalent to the
 amount of resistance and phase shift between electrical current and voltage . The usual frequency r
ange for alternating current ( AC ) applied during SIP surveys is tens of kHz to mHz . As with other
 geophysical methods , SIP aims to distinguish material properties of the subsurface , such as salin
ity and saturation . NPR ( formerly National Public Radio ) is a media organization that serves as a
 national syndicator to most public radio stations in the United States . NPR may also refer to :Uni
