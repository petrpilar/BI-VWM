me extending over 300 nucleotides and is translated into the sialoglycoprotein found on Ge-2 , -3 re
d cells . A second 3.4 kilobase pair deletion within the glycophorin C gene eliminates only exon 2 b
y a similar mechanism and generates the mutant gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein found on 
Ge-2 , +3 erythrocytes . The Ge2 epitope is antigenic only on glycophorin D and is a cryptic antigen
 in glycophorin C. It is located within exon 2 and is sensitive to trypsin and papain but resistant 
to chymotrypsin and pronase . The Ge3 epitope is encoded by exon 3 . It is sensitive to trypsin but 
resistant to chymotrypsin , papain and pronase . It is thought to lie in the between amino acids 42-
50 in glycophorin C ( residues 21-49 in 21 amino acids of glycophorin C. It is sensitive to trypsin 
, papain , pronase and neuraminidase.Leach antigenThe relatively rare Leach phenotype is due either 
to a deletion in exons 3 and 4 or to a frameshift mutation causing a premature stop codon in the gly
