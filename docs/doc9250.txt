t some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted u
ranium in penetrator ammunitions , such as tungsten-cobalt or tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloys , also p
ossess extreme carcinogenic properties , which by far exceed those ( confirmed or suspected ) of dep
leted uranium itself : 100% of rats implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed lethal rhabdomy
osarcoma within a few weeks . Depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-shar
pening and pyrophoric . On impact with a hard target , such as an armored vehicle , the nose of the 
rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp . The impact and subsequent release of heat energy
 causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its pyrophoric properties
 . When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle it catches fire and possibly caus
ing the vehicle to explode . DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the
