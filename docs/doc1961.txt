wer Lias in the Jurassic system .Alkborough FlatsAlkborough Flats is an area of low-lying arable far
mland of nearly 990acre km2 situated at the Confluence of the Rivers ( Trent Falls ) where the River
s Trent and Ouse join to form the Humber estuary . The alluvial plain and is now jointly owned by th
e UK 's Environment Agency and English Nature . Flood defences which were built in the 1950s to prot
ect the area have been breached to allow water to reclaim the land at high tide and in times of floo
ding . The project created 495acre km2 of new intertidal habitat in the inner part of the Humber est
uary . The new grassland will be managed to encourage biodiversity , with reedbeds , lagoons and gra
zing areas . Alkborough Flats is the first coastal realignment site to be developed as part of the H
umber Shoreline Management Plan . This managed retreat strategy should lessen the risks of flooding 
in low-lying towns along the Ouse and habitat around the estuary .WalcotWalcot is an outlying hamlet
