peed transmission . The CVT raises the transmission ratio by more than 20% compared to other CVTs in
 its class , providing enhanced responsiveness on starting and acceleration and improved quietness d
uring high-speed driving . With the auxiliary transmission , the size and weight of the CVT unit is 
significantly reduced . Friction is reduced by about 30% compared to other CVTs in its class , achie
ved by the increased transmission ratio , reduced pulley size and weight , and reduced oil agitating
 resistance helping improve fuel economy . An electric oil pump is adopted in vehicles equipped with
 Idling Stop . Quicker oil pressure response improves startup performance and thus contributes to an
 improvement in fuel economy . While Idling Stop is in operation , pulley rotation is the engine sta
