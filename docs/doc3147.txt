rtificial island in the world . The island was named after Ren Levasseur , the chief engineer respon
sible for the construction of Hydro-Qubec 's Daniel-Johnson Dam on the Manicouagan River , which cre
ated the Manicouagan Reservoir . The structure is the world 's largest multiple-arch dam . Levasseur
 died at the age of 35 , only days before the dam 's inauguration . There is an Innu anecdote concer
ning Ren Levasseur 's and Daniel Johnson , Sr. The Manicouagan Reservoir , and Ren-Levasseur Island 
are sometimes called the eye of Quebec . The Island is currently the subject of an ongoing legal bat
tle , as the Innu First Nation of Betsiamites is taking legal action to protect its indigenous land 
from logging . The Quebec Court of Appeal recently made a ruling allowing Kruger Inc. to resume its 
logging activities ( April 28 , 2006 ) . The Island is also the object of an environmental/ecologica
l campaign lobbying the government of Qubec to create a protected area spanning the entire Island .
