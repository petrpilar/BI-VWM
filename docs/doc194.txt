hile leaving healthy cells unharmed . In the mouse model of human breast cancer , the treatment was 
found to significantly reduce the tumors growth . This new form of treatment harming healthy cells ,
 a common pitfall of chemotherapy , and no probability of genetic mutation that usually accompanies 
gene therapy . A nano-network of nanoparticles with a solid core of insulin , modified dextran and g
lucose oxidase was demonstrated to be able to regulate and maintain normal blood sugar level in a mo
use model with Type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days . The nanoparticle is coated with either the positi
vely charged chitosan ( from shrimp shells ) or negatively charged alginate ( from seaweed ) . The o
pposite charges hold the nanoparticles together as a nano-network even after they are injected subcu
taneously . The porous particles allow blood to make contact with the nanoparticle cores . When ther
