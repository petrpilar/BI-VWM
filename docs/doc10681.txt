Lingulodinium polyedrumdoes not contain significant amounts of long chain aliphatics , nor is it pri
marily aromatic , but that it is a highly crosslinked carbohydrate-based polymer . Furthermore , din
osporin may be taxon specific as species within the same genus exhibited different compositions , so
 that dinosporin may be more accurately thought of as a suite of related but chemically distinguisha
ble biopolymers . Studies of dinosporin composition and structure are complicated by the fact that t
he cysts have to either have the cell contents effectively removed ( cysts generated in culture ) or
 be individually picked ( cysts from sediments ) in order to ensure sample purity . The culture-deri
ved cysts risk condensation of the cell content and modification of the cyst wall while the cysts pi
cked from sediment are time consuming to acquire and may have been altered by post-mortem processes 
. For example , the macromolecular composition of the fossil dinoflagellate cystThalassiphora pelagi
