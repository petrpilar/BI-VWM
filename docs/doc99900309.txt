his force but was defeated by them at Aberfoyle . Glencairn 's forces also fought against Cromwell a
t the Battle of Tullich in 1652 . The Royalist army continued to grow but dissension developed when 
command was reassigned from Glencairn to John Middleton , 1st Earl of Middleton . This was largely d
ue to petty disputes between Glencairn 's and Middleton 's respective forces . The former being main
ly Scottish Lowlanders and the latter being mainly Scottish Highlanders . This eventually led to a d
uel between one of Middleton 's officers , Sir George Munro and Glencairn himself . They duelled was
 placed under arrest by the orders of Middleton and his sword was taken from him . The following day
 two junior officers from the two camps had a duel of their own in which one was killed and the othe
r was later arrested and hanged . John Middleton , 1st Earl of Middleton was later defeated at the B
attle of Dalnaspidal on 19 July 1654 and that ended the insurrection.NotesP. viticola may refer to :
