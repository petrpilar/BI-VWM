The group , SOS Levasseur arose in 2003 partly from the interest that mainstream environmental group
s that Ren-Levasseur Island be protected in whole . The Island has been proposed as a Canadian Natio
nal Park , an ecological reserve , a biodiversity reserve and an exceptional geological site . There
 seems to be an exceptional concentration of old-growth boreal forest stands on the island . SOS Lev
asseur has been conducting research expeditions to the Island since January 2005 , whose aim is to i
dentify old-growth forest stands and to obtain their protection under the Quebec Forest Law as Excep
tional Forest Ecosystems ( EFE ) . The Ministry of Natural Resources and Fauna ( MRNFQ ) , along wit
h Kruger Inc. have already Identified 7 EFEs spanning approximately 25 km . SOS Levasseur has submit
ted an additional 7 surveyed in the summer of 2005 , and is expected to submit many more from the 20
06 and 2007 expeditions . The MRNFQ has yet to recognize the 7 sites proposed by SOS Levasseur . Ima
