tions require farmers who plant Bt corn to plant non-Bt corn nearby ( called a refuge ) to provide a
 location to harbor vulnerable pests . The theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of r
esistance to the pesticide . EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to mai
ntain refuges , to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the EPA . A study of these
 reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above corn farmers 
did not keep refuges properly , raising concerns that resistance would develop . Unmodified crops re
ceived most of the economic benefits of Bt corn in the US in 1996-2007 , because of the overall redu
ction of pest populations . This reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified
 strains alike .ResistanceResistant strains of the European corn borer have developed in areas with 
defective or absent refuge management . In November 2009 , Monsanto scientists found the pink bollwo
