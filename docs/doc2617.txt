S patent on recombinant DNA in 1974 , listing the inventors as Stanley N. Cohen and Herbert W. Boyer
 this patent was awarded in 1980 . The first licensed drug generated using recombinant DNA technolog

 considered particularly risky . This moratorium was widely observed until the National Institutes o
