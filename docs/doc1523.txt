encies still remain active when only one runway is active , both ATIS services will have a recorded 
message saying single runway operations after it gives the runway in use when this is the case .Tech
nical backgroundATIS systems can be classified into solid-state and PC-based . Solid-state ATIS syst
ems are microcontroller-powered devices that incorporate speech synthesis and data processing in a s
ingle piece of proprietary equipment , while PC-ATIS systems are based on COTS-hardware , like norma
l rack-mounted PCs with multiple high-performance soundcards ( D-ATIS ) . D-ATIS is a text-based , d
igitally transmitted version of the ATIS audio broadcast . It is accessed via a data link service su
ch as the ACARS and displayed on an electronic display in the aircraft . D-ATIS is incorporated on t
he aircraft as part of its electronic system , such as an EFB or an FMS . D-ATIS may be incorporated
 into the core ATIS system , or be realized as a separate system with a data interface between voice
