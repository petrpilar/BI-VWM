 to Job in the following way ,In tempestuous times , when the foundation of existence is tottering ,
 when the moment shivers in anxious expectancy of what may come , when every explanation falls silen
t at the spectacle of the wild tumult , when a persons innermost being groans in despair and in bitt
erness of soul cries to heaven , then Job still walks along , at the generations side and guarantees
 that there is a victory , guarantees that even if the single individual loses in the struggle , the
re is still a God who , just as he proportions every temptation humanly , even though the person did
 not withstand the temptation , bear it yes , even more gloriously than any human expectancy . Only 
the defiant person could wish that Job did not exist , that he could completely divest his soul of t
he last love still present in the wail of despair , that he could whine about life , indeed curse li
fe in such a way that there would not be even an echo of faith and trust and humility in his words ,
