n the case of an M4 layout , distributes power to both front and rear axles . The centre differentia
l contained within many 4 wheel drive cars is similar to the conventional differential in a 2 wheel 
drive car . It allows torque to be distributed to both drive axles whilst allowing them to spin at d
ifferent speeds , which vastly improves the cornering of a 4 wheel drive car on surfaces with high g
rip the drive axles which are configured to provide torque equally to both wheels , the centre diffe
rential is usually set to have a bias to one set of drive wheels or the other , depending on applica
tion of the car . Some 4 wheel drive cars use a centre viscous coupling unit that will provide most 
power to the rear wheels unless the amount of torque being supplied to the rear wheels is in excess 
of the traction limits of the rear tyres , such as in a Lamborghini Murcilago . Others contain a com
puter that will decide how much power to distribute to any wheel at any time depending on the circum
