. This method is a slightly simplified version of the method used by Appleton and his colleagues to 
work out a first value for the height of the ionosphere in 1924 . In their experiment , they used th
e BBC broadcasting station in Bournemouth to vary the wavelengths of its emissions after the evening
 programmes had finished . They installed a receiving station in Oxford to monitor the interference 
effects . The receiving station emitter at the right distance of about 100 km from Cambridge in thos
e days . This frequency modulation method revealed that the point from which waves were being reflec
ted was approximately 90 km . However , it did not establish that the waves were reflected from abov
e , indeed they may have been coming from hills somewhere between Oxford and Bournemouth . The secon
d method , which involved finding the angle of incidence of the reflected waves at the receiver , sh
owed for sure that they were coming from above . Triangulations from this angle gave results for the
