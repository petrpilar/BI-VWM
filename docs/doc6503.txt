ve to keep Tobiah out of to Nehemiah . Additionally , Tobiah had established a close relationship wi
th Eliashib the High Priest , whose grandson had married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite , su

e work of the temple and the temple workers themselves , so that Tobiah could conduct business in th
e newly constructed temple . Upon hearing this , Nehemiah , who was then in Babylon serving Artaxerx

s belongings out of the temple room , purified the room , and put back all that had originally been 
there . It is possible , though uncertain , that Tobiah the Ammonite may be related to other Tobiahs
