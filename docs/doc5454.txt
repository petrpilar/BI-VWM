neurons deep within the living brain , again with minimal damage to the brain . New computer softwar
e methods comprise a new type of imaging technology that can monitor the process of dendritogenesis 
and can help give evidence to either dissent with or support the synaptotropic hypothesis .Applicati
onsDynamic morphometrics and other imaging techniques have been used to observe both dendrite growth
 and synaptogenesistwo processes between which the relationship is not well understood . Non-spiny d
endritic arbors expressing a fluorescent postsynaptic marker protein were imaged as they arborized (
 in the zebrafish larvae ) , and this confirmed the role of newly extended dendritic filopodia in sy
naptogenesis , their maturation into dendritic branches , and the result , namely , growth and branc
hing of the dendritic arbor . These findings support the model wherein synapse formation can direct 
dendrite arborization , a basic tenet of the synaptotropic hypothesis . Route 150 is a state highway
