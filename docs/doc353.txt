he biochemistry of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium .Radiological hazardsThe primary 
radiation danger from pure depleted uranium is due to alpha particles , which do not travel far thro
ugh air , and do not penetrate clothing . However , in a matter of a month or so , a sample of pure 
depleted uranium will generate small amounts of thorium-234 and protactinium-234 , which emit the mo
re penetrating beta particles at almost the same rate as the uranium emits alpha rays . This is beca
use uranium-238 decays directly to thorium-234 , which with a half-life of 24 days decays to protact
inium-234 , which in turn decays in a matter of hours to the long-lived uranium-234 . A quasi-steady
 state is therefore reached within a few multiples of 24 days . Available evidence suggests that the
 radiation risk is small relative to the chemical hazard . Surveying the veteran-related evidence pe
