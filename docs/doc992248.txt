 Farm : A ten-acre CCOF-certified organic farm , whose produce supplements the meals in the dining h
all .Traditions held at the monasteryTwo distinguishing features of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas
 are that unlike many other Chinese Buddhist monasteries , the monastics always wear their kasaya sa
shes ( long sashes that are worn outside the monastic clothing ) , and they eat only one meal a day 
and only and rest , not lying down to sleep . Monastics at the city do not have any social lives , n
or do men and women intermingle . Whereas many ordinary Chinese monks go out to perform rituals for 
events such as weddings or funerals , none of these monks do so . Some monastics even choose to main
tain a vow of silence , for varying periods of time . They wear a tag saying No Talking and do not s
peak with anyone . There are monks and nuns who maintain the precept of not owning personal wealth a
nd not touching money , thus eliminating the thought of money and increasing their purity of mind .
