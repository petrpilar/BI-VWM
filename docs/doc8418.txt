This abnormal tissue will never function as normal lung tissue . The underlying cause for CPAM is un
known . It occurs in approximately 1 in every 30,000 pregnancies . In most cases the outcome of a fe

f the surrounding lung and cause pressure against the heart . In these situations , the CPAM can be 
life-threatening for the fetus . CPAM can be separated into five types , based on clinical and patho
logic features . CPAM type 1 is the most common , with large cysts and a good prognosis . a poor pro
gnosis , owing to its frequent association with other significant anomalies . Other types are rare .
