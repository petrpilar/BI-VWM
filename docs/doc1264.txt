cury-arc rectifier instead of an open air discharge to produce the light . He was able to achieve a 
flash duration of 10 microseconds , and was able to His colleague 's interest in the new flash appar
atus soon provoked Edgerton to improve upon the design . The mercury lamp 's efficiency was limited 
by the coolest part of the lamp , causing them to perform better when very hot but poorly when cold 
. Edgerton decided to try a noble gas , feeling that it would not be as temperature dependent as mer
cury , and , in 1930 , he employed the General Electric company to construct some lamps using argon 
instead . The argon tubes were much more efficient , compact , and could be mounted near a reflector
 , concentrating their output . Slowly , camera designers began to take notice of the new technology
 and began to accept it . Edgerton received his first major order for the strobes from the Kodak com
