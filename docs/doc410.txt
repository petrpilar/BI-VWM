 ( see Borel measure ) . In the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analyt
ically . The next chapters expand theComptes Rendusnotes dealing with length , area and applicable s

 integration regarded as the search for a primitive function is the keynote of the book . Lebesgue p
