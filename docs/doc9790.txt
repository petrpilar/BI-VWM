at deacetylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine to produce glycerophosphocholine . It is thought t
o function in neurite outgrowth and process elongation during neuronal differentiation . The protein
 is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum in both neurons and non-neuronal c
ells .FunctionNeuropathy target esterase is an enzyme with phospholipase B activity : It sequentiall
y hydrolyses both fatty acids from the major membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine , which generates wa
ter-soluble glycerophosphocholine . In cells of eukaryotes from yeast to humans , NTE is anchored to
 the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is particularly abundant in neurons 
, the placenta , and the kidney . Loss of NTE activity results in abnormally elevated levels of phos
phatidylcholine in brain and impairment of the constitutive secretory pathway in neurons . In kidney
 , the expression of neuropathy target esterase is regulated by TonEBP as part of Clinical significa
