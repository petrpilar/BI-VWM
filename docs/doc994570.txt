e . This was a decisive disadvantage , because the regiment 's 70 LT vz. 34 and LT vz. 35 light tank
s , 30 KD/Praga Tanik vz. 33 tankettes , 3 OA vz. 27 and 10 OA vz. 30 armoured cars were more than a
 match for the five obsolete Fiat 3000B light armoured cars of the Hungarian invasion force . The on
ly armour Malr had available in Eastern Slovakia were the 8 OA vz. 30 armoured cars and nine LT vz. 
35 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Preov . However ,

 were immediately available when the fighting started on March 23.VI Corps Commander-in-Chief : Lieu
