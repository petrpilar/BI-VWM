itial , open fracture reduction and then pin insertion and fixator placement . In 1938 , Raoul Hoffm
ann of Geneva realized that major improvements were essential to make the external fixator more clin
ically relevant . He developed a technique based on closed reduction with guided percutaneous pin pl
acement . Hoffmanns technique exemplified the first application of minimally invasive orthopaedic su
rgery . In the 1950s , Gavriil Ilizarov of Kurgan , Soviet Union , devised and developed a new metho
d for treating fractures , deformities and other bone defects . A metal frame that encircles the lim
b is attached to the underlying bone by crossing ( X ) pins inserted through the bone and limb . The
 external rings are linked to each other by threaded rods and hinges that allow to move the position
 of the bone fragments without opening the fracture site , then the fragments can be fixed in rigid 
position until complete healing .TypesIlizarov apparatus Taylor Spatial Frame Hoffmann external fixa
