reactor fuel made from natural uranium will have a lower-than-natural U-235 concentration . Such ' r
eactor-depleted ' material will have different isotopic ratios from enrichment byproduct DU , and ca
n be distinguished from it by the presence of U-236 . Trace transuranics ( another indicator of the 
use of reprocessed material ) have been reported to be present in some US tank armor . The use of DU
 in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects . Norma
l functioning and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure , because uranium is a 
toxic metal . It is only weakly radioactive because of its long radioactive half-life ( 4.468 billio
n years for uranium-238 , 700 million years for uranium-235 ) . The biological half-life ( the avera
ge time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body ) for uranium is about 
15 days . The aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced during impact and combustion of deplet
