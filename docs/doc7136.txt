a river ( past Opis , though the battle is not mentioned ) , where the Persians fought a battle with
 the Babylonians near the capital . Cyrus subsequently laid siege to Babylon , ordering his troops t
o dig a canal to drain off part of the Euphrates to enable his defences . Xenophon provides a simila
r but more elaborate account , claiming that Cyrus dug a huge trench around the city to divert the E
uphrates and make the river bed passable for the Persian army . Herodotus , Xenophon and the Biblica
l Book of Daniel all assert that the Babylonians were taken by surprise while celebrating a festival
 . Berossus presents an account that is different again , asserting that Cyrus defeated Nabonidus , 
who fled with certain others and shut himself up in Borsippa . Meanwhile Cyrus occupied Babylon and 
ordered to destroy the exterior walls of the city , because the city seemed very formidable to him a
nd difficult to capture . Afterward Cyrus marched to Borsippa , in order to organize the siege again
