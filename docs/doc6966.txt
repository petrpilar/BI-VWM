tly built after the Second World War . The Lower Farm council estate was built at Little Bloxwich in
 the 1960s on the site of a farm called Lower Farm . Ultrasound EnergyUltrasound energy , simply kno
wn as ultrasound , is a type of mechanical energy called sound characterized by vibrating or moving 
particles within a medium . Ultrasound is distinguished by vibrations with a frequency greater than 
20,000 Hz , compared to audible sounds that humans typically hear with frequencies between 20 and 20
,000 Hz . Ultrasound energy requires matter or a medium with particles to vibrate to conduct or prop
agate its energy . The energy generally travels through most mediums in the form of a wave in which 
particles are deformed or displaced by the energy then reestablished after the energy passes . Types
 of waves include shear , surface , and longitudinal waves with the latter being one of the most com
mon used in biological applications . The characteristics of the traveling ultrasound energy greatly
