ajectories .Differentiation within EBsWithin the context of ESC differentiation protocols , EB forma
tion is often used as a method for initiating spontaneous differentiation toward the three germ line
ages . EB differentiation begins with the specification of the exterior cells toward the primitive e
ndoderm phenotype . The cells at the exterior then deposit extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , containing
 collagen IV and laminin , similar to the composition and structure of basement membrane . In respon
se to the ECM deposition , EBs often form a cystic cavity , whereby the cells in contact with the ba
sement , resulting in a fluid-filled cavity surrounded by cells . Subsequent differentiation proceed
s to form derivatives of the three germ lineages . In the absence of supplements , the default diffe
rentiation of ESCs is largely toward ectoderm , and subsequent neural lineages . However , alternati
ve media compositions , including the use of fetal bovine serum as well as defined growth factor add
