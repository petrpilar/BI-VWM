specific and well-understood mechanisms one of the major impacts of nanotechnology and nanoscience w
ill be in leading development of completely new drugs with more useful behavior and less side effect
s . Polymeric nano-particles are a competing technology to lipidic ( based mainly on Phospholipids )
 nano-particles . There is an additional risk of toxicity associated with polymers not widely studie
d or understood . This toxicity could include ( but not limited to ) hepatotoxicity , nephrotoxicity
 etc. and can have long term impacts not easily evaluated in short term in-vivo clinical trials eith
er in animals or humans . Since the degradation of polymers to either their monomers or other degrad
ation products in the body can not be accurately predicted ( unclear metabolic pathway ) , this is a
 real risk , specially in medicines intended for long term patient use . Even if the toxicity is ign
ored , there is additional hepatic load of metabolism , again an area of concern for long term medic
