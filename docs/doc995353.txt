the study of the relationship between structure and reactivity of organic molecules . More specifica
lly , physical organic chemistry applies the experimental tools of physical chemistry to the study o
f the structure of organic molecules and provides a theoretical framework which interprets how struc
ture influences both mechanisms and rates of organic reactions . It can be thought of as a subfield 
that bridges organic chemistry with physical chemistry . The termphysical organic chemistrywas itsel
f coined by Louis Hammett in 1940 when he used the phrase as a title for his textbook . Physical org
anic chemists use both experimental and theoretical disciplines such as spectroscopy , spectrometry 
, crystallography , computational chemistry , and quantum theory to study both the rates of organic 
reactions and the relative chemical stability of the starting materials , transition states , and pr
