ients . Furthermore , there have been acoustic studies in the warm-core ring , which showed intense 
sound scattering from zooplankton and fish populations in the ring and very sparse acoustic signals 
outside of it . Copepods have been used as indicator-species of water masses . It has been suggested
 that copepods have been transported from the Kuroshio Current into southwest Taiwan through the Luz
on Strait . The Kuroshio intrusion through the Luzon Strait and further into the South China Sea may
 explain why copepods show a very high diversity in adjacent waters of the intrusion areas . The Kur
oshio Current intrusion has a major influence onC. sinicusandE. concinna, which are two copepod spec
ies with higher index values for winter and originate from the East China Sea . During the southwest
ern monsoon , the South China Sea Surface . As a result of this water circulation , the zooplankton 
communities in the boundary waters are unique and diverse .FishThe biomass of fish stocks depends on
