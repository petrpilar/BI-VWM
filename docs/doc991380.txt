l types that comprise embryoid bodies include embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) derived from the blastoc
yst stage of embryos from mouse ( mESC ) , primate , and human ( hESC ) sources . Additionally , EBs
 can be formed from embryonic stem cells derived through alternative techniques , including somatic 
cell nuclear transfer or the reprogramming of somatic cells to yield induced pluripotent stem cells 
( iPS ) . Similar to ESCs cultured in monolayer formats , ESCs within embryoid bodies undergo differ
entiation and cell specification along the three germ lineages endoderm , ectoderm , and mesoderm wh
ich comprise all somatic cell types . In contrast to monolayer cultures , however , the spheroid str
uctures that are formed when ESCs aggregate enables the non-adherent culture of EBs in suspension , 
making EB cultures inherently scalable , which is useful for bioprocessing approaches , whereby larg
e yields of cells can be produced for potential clinical applications . Additionally , although EBs
