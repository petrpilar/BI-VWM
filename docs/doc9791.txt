nceMutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia , and the protein is the 
target for neurodegeneration induced by organophosphorus compounds and chemical warfare agents . Rec
essively-inherited mutations inNTEthat substantially reduce its catalytic activity cause a rare form
 of hereditary spastic paraplegia ( SPG39 ) , in which distal parts of long spinal axons degenerate 
leading to limb weakness and paralysis . Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy a paralysing syn
drome with distal degeneration of long axons results from poisoning with neuropathic organophosphoru
s compounds that irreversibly inhibit NTE. Organocerium compounds are chemical compounds that contai
n one or more chemical bond between carbon and cerium . Organocerium chemistry is the corresponding 
science exploring properties , structure and reactivity of these compounds . In general , organoceri
um compounds are not isolable , and are rather studied in solution via their reactions with other sp
