footswitch . Proportional myoelectric control of robotic lower limb exoskeletons has advantages over
 other control methods , such as : Its physiological nature allows for an effective way to scale the
 magnitude of mechanical assistance from the exoskeleton It results in reduced biological muscle rec
ruitment versus kinematic based control methods It allows easy adaptation of the exoskeleton control
 for new motor tasks However , proportional myoelectric control also has disadvantages compared to o
ther control methods , including : The surface electrode interface can often cause difficulties in o
btaining a reliable EMG signal The system requires tuning to determine the appropriate thresholds an
d gains The musculoskeletal system has many synergistic muscles that are not easily accessible via s
urface EMG electrodes Since neurological disorders result in decreased neuromuscular control , some
