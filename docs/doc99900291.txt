ocity moments Cartesian moments for single imagesA Cartesian moment of a single image is calculated 
by : mpq = sumx=1M sumy=1N xp yq Pxy where M and Pxy is the intensity of the pixel at the point ( x 
, y ) in the image , and xp yq is the basis function .Cartesian velocity moments for sequences of im
agesCartesian velocity moments are based on these Cartesian moments . A Cartesian velocity moment vm
pqmugamma is defined by : vmpqmugamma = sumi=2images sumx=1M sumy=1N U ( i , mu , gamma ) C ( i , p 
, g ) Pixy where M and N are again the dimensions of the image , images is the number of images in t
he sequence , and Pixy is the intensity of the pixel at the point ( x , y ) in image i . C ( i , p ,
