icities . The hard-soft acid-base principle is utilized to predict molecular interactions and reacti
on direction . In general , interactions between molecules of the same type are preferred . That is 
, hard acids will associate with hard bases , and soft acids with soft bases . The concept of hard a
cids and bases is often exploited in the synthesis of inorganic coordination complexes .KineticsPhys
ical organic chemists use the mathematical foundation of chemical kinetics to study the rates of rea
ctions and reaction mechanisms . Unlike thermodynamics , which is concerned with the relative stabil
ities of the products and reactants ( G ) and their equilibrium concentrations , the study of kineti
cs focuses on the free energy of activation ( G  ) -- the difference in free energy between the reac
tant structure and the transition state structureof a reaction , and therefore allows a chemist to s
tudy the process of equilibration . Mathematically derived formalisms such as the Hammond Postulate
