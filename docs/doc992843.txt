lve gear had previously been fitted to a batch of twenty Black Fives , nos. 44738-57 , built in 1948
 . The valve gear on these was driven by one drive-line between the frames , driven from the leading
 coupled axle . Although these locomotives developed a great deal of power at high speeds and were f
ree in coasting , acceleration at low speeds was poor . 44686 and 44687 were fitted with a modified 
form of valve gear , with an external shaft on each side , driven by a worm gear mounted on a flycra
nk attached to the driving axle . The British Caprotti valve gear was a new development of Caprotti 
valve gear by the Associated Locomotive Engineers , under the leadership of L.A. Daniels . 44686 and
 44687 emerged from Horwich works cost 20,642 each , over 5,000 more than a contemporary standard Cl
ass Five . This was in part because of the high cost of development for a type of which only two exa
mples were built . For much of their lives they were allocated to Longsight. 44686 was withdrawn in
