nDirect proportional control works well when each joint of the exoskeleton is actuated in one direct
ion ( uni-directional actuation ) , such as a pneumatic piston only bending the knee , but is less e
ffective when two joint actuators work in opposition ( bi-directional actuation ) . An example of th
is would be ankle exoskeleton using one pneumatic artificial muscle for dorsiflexion based on tibial
is anterior ( shin muscle ) EMG and another pneumatic artificial muscle for plantar flexion based on
 soleus ( calf muscle ) EMG . This could result in a large degree of co-activation of the two actuat
ors and make walking more difficult.Ferris , D.P. , Gordon , K.E. , Sawicki , G.S . and Peethambaran

 control scheme so that artificial dorsiflexor activation is inhibited when soleus EMG is above a se
