he needs of all students , as compared to the common practice in other nations in which examinations
 are used to sort students into different high schools for different populations . Some high schools
 specialize in University-preparatory school academic preparation , some in remedial instruction , a
nd some in vocational instruction . The average comprehensive high school offers more than one cours
