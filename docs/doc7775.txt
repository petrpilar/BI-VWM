 Cardiff docks continued to boom as a location for shipping companies , but the fall in demand for W
elsh coal caused a dramatic fall in exports . By 1932 , in the depths of the Great Depression which 
followed the General Strike in 1926 , coal exports had fallen to below 5 million tonnes and dozens o
f locally owned ships were laid-up . Despite and the attentions of the Nazi German Luftwaffe during 
the Cardiff Blitz , coal exports continued to decline , finally ceasing in 1964 . In 1950 , imports 
outstripped exports for the first time in the port 's history . The 1970s saw a short-term import bo
om , and in the 1980s the port experienced a slight rise in traffic , while much of the former port 
area began to be regenerated into non-port uses . The port found a niche as an important local centr
e for general cargo operations .Modern Port FacilitiesCardiff now has three operational docks capabl
e of handling ships of up to 35,000 tons deadweight . The port has transit sheds with 258500m2 sqft
