s of Hawazma in Kosti , Middle Sudan , Um Rowaba , Eastern part of Kordofan and Al Rahad , middle-ea
stern part of Kordofan . The journey continued beyond Kordofan , to Darfur on the Western Sudan and 
today they have reached Chad , the country on western border of Sudan . Wherever Baggara settle they
 start a seasonal nomadic movement that goes from north to south , to their historical migration rou
te . Mostly they only follow two routes , one route from north to south and different route from sou
th to north . But the routes are not far apart , and they are permanent , they never change them . A
ny tribe has its own routes . Hawazma are mostly found in routes originating from Al Obeid city in N
orth Kurdufan , through Deling city and its eastern part , Kadugli city and its eastern part , to Ta
lodi region . Messiria just borders them to the west . Humr borders Messiria to the west . And so fo
rth . Today the Hawazma in particular and Baggara in general bear little resemblance to Bedouin Arab
