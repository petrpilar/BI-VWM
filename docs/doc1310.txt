d free electrons to be the ionising agents . He discovered that the layer could be penetrated by wav
es above a certain frequency and that this critical frequency could be used to calculate the electro
n density in the layer . However these penetrating waves would also be reflected back , but from a m
uch higher layer . This showed the ionosphere had a much more complex structure than first anticipat
ed . The lower level was labelled E Layer , reflected longer wavelengths and was found to be at appr
oximately 125 km . The high level , which had much higher electron density , was labelled F Layer an
d could reflect much situated 300 400 km above the earths surface . It is this which is often referr
ed to as the Appleton Layer as is responsible for enabling most long range short wave telecommunicat
ion . The magneto-ionic theory also allowed Appleton to explain the origin of the mysterious fadings
 heard on the radio around sunset . During the day , the light from the sun causes the molecules in
