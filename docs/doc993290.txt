compete as a trials car , and was constructed on an Austin 7 chassis and running gear and given regi
stration number OX 9292 . Chapman built the body utilizing a composite made of thin aluminum bonded 
to plywood . He modified the rear suspension to give better handling and the engine to give more pow
er . His approach to automobile construction using sound engineering principles and ingenious chassi
s design set the stage for many more revolutionary designs to follow . Although the original Mark I 
has been lost to history , a replica ( see photo ) was created to the same dimensions that uses an i
dentical Austin chassis and running gear . Chapman and his future wife competed with the car in Engl
ish Trials , a form of competition over rough terrain against time . Chapman continued to develop an
d modify the Mark I. First larger wheels and tyres were fitted and the to provide independent front 
suspension . The success of the car helped encourage Chapman to continue designing competition cars
