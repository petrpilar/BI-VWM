se and only those pairs x , y of polynomials ( of degrees n-1 and m-1 , respectively ) which fulfill
 : x cdot p + y cdot q = 0 ( where polynomial multiplication and addition is used in this last line 
) . This means the kernel of the transposed Sylvester matrix gives all and deg y 1524307 . Consequen
tly the rank of the Sylvester matrix determines the degree of the greatest common divisor ofpandq: :
