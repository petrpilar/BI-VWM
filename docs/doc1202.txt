l discipline of linear algebra , the Schur decomposition or Schur triangulation , named after Issai 
Schur , is a matrix decomposition .StatementThe Schur decomposition reads as follows : ifAis an&ampt
imes nsquare matrix with complex entries , thenAcan be expressed as : A = Q U Q-1 whereQis a unitary
 matrix ( so that its inverseQ 1 is also the conjugate transposeQ ofQ) , andUis an upper triangular 
matrix , which is called a Schur form ofA. SinceUis similar toA, it has the same multiset of eigenva
lues , and since it is triangular , those eigenvalues are the diagonal entries ofU. ofA-invariant su
