cation .HistoryThe flashtube was invented by Harold Edgerton in moving objects . Flashtubes were mai
nly used for strobe lights in scientific studies , but eventually began to take the place of chemica
l and powder flash lamps in mainstream photography . Early high-speed photographs were taken with an
 open-air electrical arc discharge , called spark photography . The earliest known use of spark phot
ography began with Henry Fox Talbot around 1850 . In 1886 , Ernst Mach used an open air spark to pho
tograph a speeding bullet , revealing the shockwaves it produced at supersonic speeds . Open air spa
rk systems were fairly easy to build , but were bulky , very limited in light output , and produced 
loud noises comparable to that of a gunshot . In 1927 , Harold Edgerton built his first flash unit w
hile at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Wanting to photograph the motion of a motor in vivid
 detail , without blur , Edgerton decided to improve the process of spark photography by using a mer
