els , and small crustaceans , but has also been known to eat molluscs , echinoderms , annelids , alg
ae and plant material .ReproductionThey can spawn between April and September , depending on the reg
ion , and produce pelagic eggs , about 2 millimeters in diameter . After hatching , the are slightly
 more common than females , but this can vary within local populations .Electric organAll species wi
thin theUranoscopusgenus , along with those inAstroscopus, have evolved electric organs , but lack r
eceptor organs . These were both independently evolved , and are the only two genera within the orde
r Perciformes to produce electric organ discharges ( EODs ) . The atlantic stargazer , like other bi
oelectrogenic stargazers , produces pulse-type EODs while feeding and when it is disturbed . The atl
antic stargazer produces EODs with the electric organ , derived from sonic muscles . In other fishes
 , sonic muscles are used to produce sound by agitating the swim bladder .ReferencesHush Little Baby
