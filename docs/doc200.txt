er could weld the artery perfectly .VisualizationTracking movement can help determine how well drugs
 are being distributed or how substances are metabolized . It is difficult to track a small group of
 cells throughout the body , so scientists used to dye the cells . These dyes needed to be excited b
y light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up . While different color dyes absorb di
fferent frequencies of light , there was a need for as many light sources as cells . A way around th
is problem is with luminescent tags . These tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrat
e cell membranes . The dots can be random in size , can be made of bio-inert material , and they dem
onstrate the nanoscale property that color is size-dependent the frequency of light used to make a g
roup of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group i
ncandesce . Then both groups can be lit with a single light source . They have also found a way to i
