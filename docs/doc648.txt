ys and watersheds to which Hebron belongs are the following : Champlain Valley / Lake George Watersh
ed02010001 Hudson River Valley / Hudson-Hoosic Watershed02020003 . Waters in the northernmost part o
f Hebron drain via the Mettawee River north into Lake Champlain , where they mix with waters from La
ke George (Horican) and then flow into the Saint Lawrence River (Kaniatarowanenneh) . These Hebron w
aters mingle in the Saint Lawrence with waters of all the Great Lakes as they flow northeast into th
e Gulf of St. Lawrence , and ultimately join the Atlantic Ocean . Meanwhile , the majority of Hebron
 waters drain south via Black Creek into the Batten Kill (Dionondehowa) and then the Hudson River (M
uh-he-kun-ne-tukor Muhheakantuck ) , and flow south into the Atlantic Ocean just below New York City
 . The two branches of Black Creek join in West Hebron after the waterfall in the West Branch of Bla
ck Creek ( which is just before Patterson Road ) . See map . See the approximation of the watershed
