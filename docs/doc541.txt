t nutritious vegetarian diets , and raise one 's own food if possible . The countryside was posited 
as a romantic alternative to urban living , and some naturists even promoted what they saw as the he
althful benefits of nudism . Globally , the naturist movement counted anarchists , liberals , and so
cialists as its followers . However , in Cuba a particular anarchist dimension evolved led by people
 like Adrin del Valle , who spearheaded the Cuban effort to shift naturism 's focus away from only i
ndividual health to naturism having a social emancipatory function . Schaffer reports the influence 
that anarcho-naturism had outside naturists circles . So For instance , nothing inherently prevented
 an anarcho-syndicalist in the Havana restaurant workers ' union from supporting the alternative hea
lth care programs of the anarcho-naturists and seeing those alternative practices as revolutionary .
