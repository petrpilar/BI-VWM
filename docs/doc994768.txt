Titration of complex alkaline solutionsThe thermometric in the production of alumina from bauxite is
 accomplished in an automated two titration sequence . This is an adaptation of a classic thermometr
ic titration application ( VanDalen and Ward , 1973 ) . In the first titration , tartrate solution i
s added to an aliquot of liquor to complex aluminate , releasing one mole of hydroxyl for each mole 
of aluminate present . This is titrated acidimetrically along with free hydroxyl present and the car
bonate content ( as a second endpoint ) . The second titration is preceded by the automatic addition
 of fluoride solution . The alumina-tartrate complex is broken in favour of the formation of an alum
inium fluoride complex and the concomitant release of three moles of hydroxyl for each mole of alumi
nium present , which are then titrated acidimetrically . The whole determination can be completed in
 less than 5 minutes .Non-aqueous acid-base titrationsNon-aqueous acid-base titrations can be carrie
