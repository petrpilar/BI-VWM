was a commercial success grossing $5 million at the box office . The film was shot in Chennai , Indi

formation group additivity methods in thermochemistry enable the calculation and prediction of heat 
of formation of organic compounds based on additivity . This method was pioneered by S. W. Benson .B
enson modelStarting with simple linear and branched alkanes and alkenes the method works by collecti
ng a large number of experimental heat of formation data ( see : Heat of Formation table ) and then 
divide each molecule up into distinct groups each consisting of a central atom with multiple ligands
 : : X-(A)i(B)j(C)k(D)l To each group is then assigned an empirical incremental value which is indep
