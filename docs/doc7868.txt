8 United States presidential election in Nebraska took place on November 4 , 2008 as part of the 200
8 United States presidential election . Voters chose 5 electors to the Electoral College , who voted
 for President and Vice President . However , this state is one of the two states of the U.S. that ,
 instead of giving all of its electors to the winner based on its statewide results , just 2 of them
 vote based on the statewide results , and the others vote based on their individual congressional d
istrict results . Nebraska , statewide , was not a swing state in 2008 . Located in the Great Plains
 of the United States , it is one of the most staunchly Republican states in the country . While som
e hypothetical general election match-up polls between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Ob
ama showed the race to be seemingly close , they were largely regarded as outliers as more polls rel
eased showed McCain leading in double digits . McCain wound up carrying the popular vote in Nebraska
