er 4X for the evolutionary approach . Computer manufacturers found address multiplexing to be a comp
elling feature as they saw a future 64Kb DRAM chip would save 8 pins if implemented with address mul
tiplexing and subsequent generations even more integrated circuits , plus the multiplexed approach u
sed less silicon area , which further reduces chip cost . The MK4096 was produced using an NMOS alum
inum-gate process with an added interconnect layer of polysilicon ( dubbed the SPIN process ) The fe
ar , uncertainty and doubt put up by the competition regarding address multiplexing was dispelled by
 the actual performance of the MK4096 which proved solid and robust in all types of computer memory 
designs . In 1976 Mostek introduced the silicon-gate MK4027 ( an improved version of the metal-gated
 MK4096 ) , and the new MK4116 16kb double-poly silicon-gate DRAM . They were designed by Paul Schro
eder , who later left Mostek to co-found Inmos . From this point until the late 1970s Mostek was a c
