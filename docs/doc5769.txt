vimetric procedure , but the time taken for a determination can be reduced from many hours to a few 
minutes . Potential interferences need to be considered .Titration of anionic and cationic surfactan
tsAnionic and cationic surfactants can be determined thermometrically by titrating one type against 
the other . For instance , benzalkonium chloride ( a quaternary type cationic surfactant ) may be de
termined in cleaners and algaecides for swimming pools and spas by titrating with a standard solutio
n of sodium dodecyl sulfate . Alternatively , anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate can 
be titrated with cetyl pyridinium chloride .Titration of non-ionic surfactantsWhen an excess of Ba 2
+ oxide derivative type , a pseudo-cationic complex is formed . This may be titrated with standard s
odium tetraphenylborate . Two moles tetraphenylborate react with one mole of the Ba 2+ / non-ionic s
urfactant complex .Miscellaneous aqueous titrations Titration of fluoride with boric acidAcidic solu
