largely exhibit heterogeneous patterns of differentiated cell types , ESCs are . Therefore , the thr
ee-dimensional structure , including the establishment of complex cell adhesions and paracrine signa
ling within the EB microenvironment , enables differentiation and morphogenesis which yields microti
ssues that are similar to native tissue structures . Such microtissues are promising to directly or 
indirectly repair damaged or diseased tissue in regenerative medicine applications , as well as for 
in vitro testing in the pharmaceutical industry and as a model of embryonic development .Formation o
f EBsEBs are formed by the homophilic binding of the Ca2+ dependent adhesion molecule E-cadherin , w
hich is highly expressed on undifferentiated ESCs . When cultured as single cells in the absence of 
anti-differentiation factors , ESCs spontaneously aggregate to form EBs . Such spontaneous formation
 is often accomplished in bulk suspension cultures whereby the dish is coated with non-adhesive mate
