outhwest from the square . Between 1969 and 1978 , Boston closed both Federal Street ( they had form
erly operated as a one-way pair ) . Summer Street has since reopened ( as a two-way road ) , but Fed
eral Street is still a pedestrian mall . The Big Dig in the late 1990s and early 2000s kept the one-
way configurations north of the square , but now Atlantic Avenue continues as one-way ( northbound )
 south of the square , and Surface Artery is one-way southbound . For some time , a temporary interc
ity bus depot for providers such as Peter Pan , Trailways and others was located just north of Dewey
 Square over the Central Artery . This temporary bus station replaced an earlier Trailways bus stati
on that had been located in Park Square . All intercity buses were relocated in 1993 to the nearby S
outh Station Bus Terminal just south of South Station , situated above the train tracks . By the 21s
t century , use of the term Dewey Square to describe the locale had all but disappeared from common
