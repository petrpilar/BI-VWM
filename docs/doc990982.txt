lley Trustees ( SVT ) released 7,000 adult alewife ( river herring ) into the Concord River . They w
ere transferred from the Nemasket River so that they could lay their eggs and spawn upstream . This 
imprinted the young alewives with the , more than 1000 juvenile alewives were observed in Heard Pond
 , located on the Sudbury River . Fishery biologists in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hope that
 after three to five years in the ocean , these fish will complete the cycle by swimming back to Hea
rd Pond again . The fishery biologists say the fish will be able to swim over the top of North Bille
rica 's Faulkner Dam on the way downstream . However , on the return trip , the fish will need to be
 transported around the dam . If a sufficient number of fish return , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Ser
vice will explore options for a more permanent solution which may include modifications to the dam .
