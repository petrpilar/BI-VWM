r (Acrobates pygmaeus) from Australia and feather-tailed possum (Distoechurus pennatus) from New Gui
nea . This family of the Diprotodontia order , which can be found in the east coast and inland of Au
stralia and in some islands of New Guinea , is characterized by their very small size , which has si
de effects : because their mass-to-surface-area ratio is so small , heat escapes quicker from their 
bodies than it would in larger animals ( the larger the mass-to-surface-area ratio , the harder it i
s to get rid of heat ) . Therefore , when temperature drops or food is scarce , they have trouble ma
intaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity ( not to be confused with
 hibernation , which is not known in marsupials ) which can last between one day and two weeks . In 
this state drops to almost that of its surroundings , and the animal becomes unresponsive .Taxonomy
