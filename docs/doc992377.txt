erlets marking the surface . The satellite crater Roche B lies across the northeastern inner wall . 
The interior floor of Roche is relatively level , but is also marked by several small and tiny crate
rlets . A grouping of these craters lies near the midpoint . Just to the northwest of this grouping 
is a bright patch of high-albedo material . Sections of the floor along the north-northwestern side 
have a lower albedo than elsewhere , usually an indication of basaltic-lava flows similar to what fi
lls actually be larger , but covered with higher-albedo ejecta.Satellite cratersBy convention these 
features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that 
is closest to Roche . Winebrenner may refer to : John Winebrenner , founder of the Churches of God G
