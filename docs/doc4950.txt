lost its viability matches the period during which the flower is sexually active , so honeyeaters ar
e enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination . This has proven an effective strateg
y : almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation . In addition , honeyeate
rs tend to move between inflorescences on different plants , rather than between inflorescences on t
he same plant , at least in high density sites . These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for
 a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen . When self-fertilisation does occur , whether autogamo
us or geitonogamous , the resulting seed is almost always aborted , and the species ultimately achie
ves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100% , at least in high density sites . Limited data for low-densi
ty sites , where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently , suggest more of a mixed-mati
ng system . The species is a prolific flowerer , and this , combined with the very high outcrossing
