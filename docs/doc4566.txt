d by MGM . New anamorphic optics were built by Panavision which were very different from CinemaScope
 lenses which used optical ground glass elements set in a frame ( e.g. , a lens ) to , however , was
 that whatever was in the center of the image tended to be stretched wider than whatever was at the 
edges . In close-up shots , this distortion was particularly noticeable . ( Actors ' faces became so
 noticeably distorted that the problem was known as the anamorphic mumps . ) Placement of a dioptre 
lens in front of the anamorphic lens could correct this problem , but itself created problems with f
ocal length , required increased light on the set , and had other issues . To avoid the anamorphic m
umps , Panavision did not use an anamorphic lens . Its new system used two prisms set at angles to a
n anamorphic 70mm camera lens to reduce the anamorphic mumps effect . This not only solved the probl
em of the anamorphic mumps but led to a less clumsy , more easily focused camera that required less
