 mission ( six years to failure for Spirit , eight years and counting for .MESSENGER ( 2004 )MESSENG
ER ( an acronym of MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry , and Ranging ) is a robotic s
pacecraft orbiting the planet Mercury , the first spacecraft ever to do so . The 485 kg spacecraft w
as launched aboard a Delta II rocket in August 2004 to study Mercury 's chemical composition , geolo
gy , and magnetic field . MESSENGER became the second mission after Mariner 10 to reach Mercury when
 it made a flyby in January 2008 , followed by a second flyby in October 2008 , and a third flyby in
 September 2009 . Then MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury on March 18 , 2011 . The instruments c
arried by MESSENGER were used on that complex series of flybys the spacecraft flew by Earth once , V
enus twice , and Mercury itself three times , allowing it to decelerate relative to Mercury using mi
nimal fuel . When MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury on March 18 , 2011 , it then reactivated it
