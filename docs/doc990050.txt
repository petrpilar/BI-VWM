d .In nuclear physics a superdeformed nucleus is a nucleus that is very far from spherical , forming
 an ellipsoid with axes in ratios of approximately 2:1:1 . Normal deformation is approximately 1.3:1
:1 . Only some nuclei can exist in superdeformed states . The first superdeformed states to be obser
ved were the fission isomers , low-spin states of elements in the actinide and lanthanide series . T
he strong force decays much faster than the Coulomb force , which becomes stronger when nucleons are
 greater than 2.5 femtometers apart . For this reason , these elements undergo spontaneous fission .
 In the late 1980s , high-spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in other regions of the 
periodic table . Specific elements include ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , silver , osmium , iridi
um , platinum , gold , and mercury . The existence of superdeformed states occurs because of a combi
