 chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is about a million times greaterin vitrothan its radiological
 hazard , with the kidney considered to be the main target organ . . Health effects of DU are determ
ined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external . Three main 
pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur : inhalation , ingestion , and embedded
 fragments or shrapnel contamination . Properties such as phase ( e.g. particulate or gaseous ) , ox
idation state ( e.g. metallic or ceramic ) , and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influen
ce their absorption , distribution , translocation , elimination and the resulting toxicity . For ex
ample , metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent of 2004 Review Information Regarding U
