unnecessarily difficult . For example , the key of D minor is not conventionally used in notated mus
ic , because its corresponding key signature would contain a B ( submediant ) . An equal-tempered sc
ale of D minor comprises the same notes as the C minor scale . Under equal temperament the scales so
und exactly the same such key pairs are said to be enharmonically equivalent . So the theoretical ke
y of D minor is usually practically notated by a key signature of C minor . class= wikitable - The o
ther option is to use either no key signature for the B s.Enharmonic equivalenceWhile a piece of Wes
tern music generally has a home key , a passage within it may modulate to another key , which is usu
