ARGIT-B ( Boost )TARGIT as a tumour bed boost : In conventional EBRT , the boost is delivered at the
 end of a complete course of EBRT . Clinical evidence suggests that TARGIT the boost can be delivere
d intraoperatively without any delay and more precisely as compared to conventional EBRT . A multice

expected rate of local recurrence ( 1.73% ) as compared to an EORTC study which used external boost 
radiation . As a tumour bed boost , TARGIT has been found to have a better than expected effectivene
ss These results have prompted the inclusion of TARGIT boost as an option to EBRT boost in national 
clinical guidelines of many countries including Germany . Whether TARGIT is superior to an EBRT boos
