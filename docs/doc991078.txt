s . One is upwelling at the periphery the other is the convective mixing caused by the cooling of su
rface water as the ring moves north of the current . The thermostad is the deep mixed layer that has
 discrete boundaries and uniform temperature . Within this layer , nutrient-rich water is brought to
 the surface , which generates a burst of primary production . Given that the water in the core of a
 ring has a different temperature regime than the shelf waters , there are times when a warm-core ri
ng is undergoing its spring bloom while the surrounding shelf waters are not . There are many comple
x interactions with the warm-core ring and thus lifetime productivity is not very different from the
 surrounding shelf water . A study in 1998 found that the primary in the cold jet outside it , with 
evidence of upwelling of nutrients within the ring . In addition , there was discovery of dense popu
lations of phytoplankton at the nutricline in a ring , presumably supported by upward mixing of nutr
