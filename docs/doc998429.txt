manner has been criticized on the grounds that the theoretical framework used to derive the noise vi
olates Lorentz-invariance . Lorentz-invariance violation is however very strongly constrained alread

al descriptionThe Holometer will consist of two power-recycled Michelson interferometers , similar t
o the LIGO instruments . The interferometers will be able to be operated in two spatial configuratio
ns , termed nested and back-to-back . According to Hogan 's hypothesis , in the nested configuration
 the interferometers ' beamsplitters should appear to wander in step with each other ( that is , the
 wandering should becorrelated ' wandering of the beamsplitters should be uncorrelated . The presenc
e or absence of the correlated wandering effect in each configuration can be determined by cross-cor
relating the interferometers ' outputs . Vinten-Johansen Ridge ( ) is a high , bare rock ridge in th
