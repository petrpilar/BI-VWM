rentials when considering virtual displacements and generalized forces . --Examples Double pendulumA
 double pendulum constrained to move in a plane may be described by the four Cartesian coordinates 1
 ,x 2 ,y 2 , but the system only has two degrees of freedom , and a more efficient system would be t
o use : lbrace q1 , q2 rbrace = lbracetheta1 , theta2 rbrace , which are defined via the following r
elations : : lbrace x1 , y1 rbrace = lbrace L1sintheta1 , L1costheta1 rbrace : lbrace x2 , y2 rbrace
 = lbrace L1sintheta1+L2sintheta2 , L1costheta1+L2costheta2 rbrace Example : Bead on a wireA bead co
nstrained to move on a wire has only one degree of freedom , and the generalized coordinate used to 
describe its motion is often : q1= l , wherelis the distance along the wire from some reference poin
t on the wire . Notice that a motion embedded in three dimensions has been reduced to only one dimen
