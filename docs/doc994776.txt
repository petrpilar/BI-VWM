ic titrimetry is particularly suited to the determination of a range of analytes where a precipitate
 is formed by reaction with the titrant . In some cases , an alternative to traditional potentiometr
ic titration practice can be offered . In other cases , reaction chemistries may be employed for whi
ch there is no satisfactory equivalent in potentiometric titrimetry.Titrations with silver nitrateTh
ermometric titrations of silver nitrate with halides and cyanide are all possible . The reaction of 
silver nitrate with chloride is strongly exothermic . For instance , the reaction is a high 61.2 kJ/
mol . This permits convenient determination of chloride with commonly available standard 0.1 mol/L A
gNO 3 . Endpoints are very sharp , and with care , chloride concentrations down to 15 mg/L can be an
alyzed . Bromide and chloride may be determined in admixture.Titration of sulfateSulfate may be rapi
dly and easily titrated thermometrically using standard solutions of Ba 2+ as titrant . Industrially
