cophorin C gene , and persons with this phenotype are less susceptible ( 60% of the control rate ) t
o invasion byPlasmodium falciparum. Such individuals have a subtype of a condition called hereditary
 elliptocytosis . The abnormally shaped cells are known as elliptocytes or cameloid cells . The basi
s for this phenotype was first reported by Telenet al .. The phenotype is Ge : -2 , -3 , -4.Yussef a
ntigenThe Yussef ( Yus ) phenotype is due to a 57 base pair deletion corresponding to exon 2 . The a
ntigen is known as GPC Yus . Glycophorin C mutations are rare in most of the Western world , but are
 more common in some places where malaria is endemic . In Melanesia a greater percentage of any othe
r part of the world . The incidence of Gerbich-negative phenotype caused by an exon 3 deletion in th
e Wosera ( East Sepik Province ) and Liksul ( Madang Province ) populations of Papua New Guinea is 0
.463 and 0.176 respectively .Webb antigenThe rare Webb ( Wb ) antigen ( 1/1000 donors ) , originally
