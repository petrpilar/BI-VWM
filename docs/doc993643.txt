rithm , published by Evgeny Yakovlevich Remez in 1934 , is an iterative algorithm used to find simpl
e approximations to functions , specifically , approximations by functions in a Chebyshev space that
 are the best in the uniform normL sense . A typical example of a Chebyshev space is the subspace of
 Chebyshev polynomials of ordernin the space of real continuous functions on an interval ,C a,b. The
 polynomial of best approximation within a given subspace is defined to be the one that minimizes th
