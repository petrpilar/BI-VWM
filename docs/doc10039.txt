ontinental blocks is debated , but some studies suggest a Gondwana affinity of many allochthonous te
rranes ( Dobretsov et al. , 2003 a Siberian or Tarim origin for the same blocks ( Kuzmichev , 2001 R

 of a huge Paleozoic subduction-accretion complex ( Sengr et al. , 1993 ) , which accumulated agains
