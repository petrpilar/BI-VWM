 wave and makes less noise during operation , vastly increasing the lifetime of the lamp . It is esp
ecially effective on very fast discharge applications , allowing the arc to expand faster and better
 fill the tube . It is very often used with simmer voltage and sometimes with series triggering , bu
t rarely used with external triggering . Prepulse techniques are most commonly used in the pumping o
f dye lasers , greatly increasing the conversion efficiency . However , it has also been shown to in
crease the efficiency of other lasers with longer fluorescence lifetimes ( allowing longer pulses ) 
, such as Nd:YAG or titanium sapphire , by creating pulses with almost square waveforms .Ablative fl
ashtubesAblative flashtubes are triggered by under-pressurizing . Ablative flashtubes are typically 
constructed using quartz tubing and one or both electrodes hollowed out , allowing a vacuum pump to 
be attached to control the gas pressure . The electrodes of the lamp are connected to a charged capa
