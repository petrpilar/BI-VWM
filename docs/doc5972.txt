of barium . Sodium-free barium chlorate can be produced directly through electrolysis : : BaCl 2 + 6
 H 2 O Ba ( ClO 3 ) 2 + 6 H 2 It can also be produced by the reaction of barium carbonate with boili
ng ammonium chlorate solution : : 2 NH 4 ClO 3 + BaCO 3 +QBa ( ClO 3 ) 2 + 2 NH 3 + H 2 O + CO 2 The
 reaction initially produces barium chlorate and ammonium carbonate boiling the solution decomposes 
the ammonium carbonate and drives off the resulting ammonia and carbon dioxide , leaving only barium
 chlorate in solution . Decomposition When exposed to heat , barium chlorate alone will decompose to
 barium chloride and oxygen : : Ba ( ClO 3 ) 2 BaCl 2 + 3O 2 Chloric acid Barium chlorate is used to
 produce chloric acid , the formal dilute sulfuric acid , which results in a solution of chloric aci
d and insoluble barium sulfate precipitate : : Ba ( ClO 3 ) 2 + H 2 SO 4 2HClO 3 + BaSO 4 Both the c
hlorate and the acid should be prepared as dilute solutions before mixing , such that the chloric ac
