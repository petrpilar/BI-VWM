n of the Robinson R22 light civilian helicopter . By using a proven helicopter airframe , engineers 
were able to focus on developing systems that could be later transferred to the A160 . The Maverick 
program began in 1998 , and the first flight took place less than a year later in 1999 . Although th

 in the event of a failure of the unmanned flight control system ) . Even its very first flight was 
truly unmanned . Since much of the software Maverick remained in service long after A160 began fligh
t operations . After acquiring Frontier Systems in 2004 , Boeing halted most development of Maverick
 , but it continued flying as a training asset and for reducing risk in technology development for t
he A160 . Four Mavericks are flown by the US Navy , carrying Wescam Electro-Optical/Infrared sensor
