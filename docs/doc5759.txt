d out advantageously by thermometric means . Acid leach solutions from some copper mines can contain
 large quantities of Fe(III) as well as Cu(II) . The free acid ( sulfuric acid ) content of these ti
trimetry can determine the free acid content with modest amounts of Fe(III) , in some solutions the 
Fe(III) content is so high as to cause serious interference . Complexation with necessarily large am
ounts of oxalate is undesirable due to the toxicity of the reagent . A thermometric titration was de
vised by diluting the aliquot with propan-2-ol and titration with standard KOH in propan-2-ol . Most
 of the metal content precipitated prior to the commencement of the titration , and a clear , sharp 
endpoint for the sulfuric acid content was obtained .Catalyzed endpoint thermometric acid-base titra

trimetry . Examples are Total Acid Number ( TAN ) in mineral and lubricating oils and Free Fatty Aci
