ts of a quantified Boolean formula =x 1 x 2 x ( ) whereQis either or . The game is played by two pla
yers ,P a andP e , who alternate choosing values for successivex i .P e wins the game if the formula
 ends uptrue, andP a wins if ends upfalse. In this proof , we assume that the quantifier list starts
 and ends with the existential qualifier , , for simplicity . Note that any expression can be conver
ted to this form by adding dummy variables that do not appear in . : By constructing a graphGlike th
e one shown above , we will show any instance of FORMULA-GAME can be reduced to an instance of Gener
alized Geography , where the optimal strategy forP 1 is equivalent to that ofstrategy forP 2 is equi
valent to that ofP a . The left vertical chain of nodes is designed to mimic the procedure of choosi
ng values for variables in FORMULA-GAME . Each diamond structure corresponds to a quantified variabl
e . Players take turns deciding paths at each branching node . Because we assumed the first quantifi
