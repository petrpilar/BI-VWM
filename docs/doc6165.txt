ms for improving the performance of TCP . Many ADN implement these RFCs in order to provide enhanced
 delivery of applications commonly implemented are : Delayed Acknowledgements Nagle Algorithm Select

ial Congestion WindowsData compression and cachingADNs also provide optimization of application data
 through caching and compression techniques . There are two types of compression used by ADNs today 
: industry standard HTTP compression and proprietary data reduction algorithms . It is important to 
note that the cost in CPU cycles to compress data when traversing a LAN can result in a negative per
formance impact and therefore best practices are to only utilize compression when delivering applica
tions via a WAN or particularly congested high-speed data link . HTTP compression is asymmetric and 
transparent to the client . Support for HTTP compression is built into web servers and web browsers
