 and soluble uranium ( VI ) salts . Soluble uranium salts are toxic . Uranium slowly accumulates in 
several organs , such as the liver , spleen , and kidneys . The World Health Organization has establ
ished a daily tolerated intake of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5 g/kg body weig
ht , or 35 g for a 70 kg adult . Epidemiological studies and toxicological tests on laboratory anima
ls point to it as being immunotoxic , and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilomete
rs from target areas , and that such particles , if inhaled , would remain undissolved in the lung f
or a great length of time and thus could be detected in urine . Violently burning uranium droplets p
roduce a gaseous vapor comprising about half of the uranium in their original mass . Uranyl ion cont
amination in uranium oxides has Approximately 90 micrograms of natural uranium , on average , exist 
in the human body as a result of normal intake of water , food and air . Most is in the skeleton . T
