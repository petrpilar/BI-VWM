nation of macroscopic and microscopic factors , which together lower their energies , and make them 
stable minima of energy as a described by the liquid drop model . The liquid drop 's energy as a fun
ction of deformation is at a minimum for zero deformation , due to the surface tension term . Howeve
r , the curve may become soft with respect to high deformations because of the Coulomb repulsion ( e
specially for the fission isomers , which have high Z ) and also , in the case of high-spin states ,
 because of the increased moment of inertia . Modulating this macroscopic behavior , the microscopic
 shell correction creates certain superdeformed magic numbers that are analogous to the spherical ma
gic numbers . For nuclei near these magic numbers , the shell correction creates a second minimum in
 the energy as a function of deformation . Even more deformed states ( 3:1 ) are called hyperdeforme
