spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology , Dewdney seems here to pillory neu

is kind of criticism , one should note that although it is true that analyzing what has been learned
 by an artificial neural network is difficult , it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has 
been learned by a biological neural network . Furthermore , researchers involved in exploring learni
