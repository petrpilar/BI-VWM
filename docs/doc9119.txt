ry ) .Types of modelsMany models are used in the field , defined at different levels of abstraction 
and modeling different aspects of neural systems . They range from models of the short-term behavior
 of individual neurons , models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions betw
een individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules 
that represent complete subsystems . These include models of the long-term , and short-term plastici
ty , of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the 
system level .Neural network softwareNeural network software is used to simulate , research , develo
