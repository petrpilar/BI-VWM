. This antigen was discovered in a Finnish man on May 5 , 1968 , during post operative blood cross m
atching for an aortic aneurism repair . In Finland the incidence of this antigen was found to be 6/1
0,000 donors . In Sweden the incidence was 2/3266 donors . The molecular basis for the origin of thi
s antigen lies within exon 2 where a G-T substitution in codon 67 ( base position 199 ) converts an 
alanine to a serine residue . While this epitope exists within glycophorin C there it is a cryptanit
gen . It is only antigenic in glycophorin D because of the truncated N terminus .OthersA duplicated 
exon 2 has erythrocytes also been reported in Japanese blood donors ( 2/10,000 new anitgen.Antibodie
sAntibodies to the Gerbich antigens have been associated with transfusion reactions and mild hemolyt
ic disease of the newborn . In other studies naturally occurring anti-Ge antibodies have been found 
and appear to be of no clinical significance . Immunological tolerance towards Ge antigen has been s
