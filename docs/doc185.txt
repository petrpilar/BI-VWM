ains of the amino acid histidine , carry a slightly negative charge when circulating in the blood st
ream , can evade detection and clearing by the immune system . When they encounter an infection site
 the particles gain a positive charge provoked by the slightly acidic environment at the infection s
ites , allowing them to bind to the negatively charged bacterial cell walls and release antibiotics 
at locally high concentration . This nano delivery system can potentially destroy bacteria even if i
t has developed resistance to antibiotics because of the targeted high dose and prolonged release of
 the drug . Although a lot of work is still needed , the researchers believe that it points to a new
 direction of using nanotechnology to treat infectious disease . Using the biomimetic strategy , res
earchers in the Harvard University Wyss Institute demonstrated in a mouse model that the drug coated
 nanoparticles regions in the blood vessels just like the platelets do . Aggregates of biodegradable
