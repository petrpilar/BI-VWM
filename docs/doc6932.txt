s , and therefore vary how much the car behaves like a front- or rear-wheel-drive car . This means t
hat through a fast corner the car is able to display more neutral handling - with less oversteer or 
understeer . This is a much more efficient means of turning and allows for faster cornering speeds a
s opposed to a two-wheel or conventional four-wheel-drive system .DrawbacksSuch a system is very dif
ficult and expensive to design and engineer , which is why it is only usually Most mid-engine cars ,
 because of the size and position of the engine and transmission , compromise heavily on both passen
ger and boot/trunk space . Four-wheel-drive systems tend to be quite heavy and some of the engine 's
 power can be lost through the various differentials in the car , in addition to the frictional loss
