 the total erythrocyte membrane protein mass . Confusingly these proteins are also known under diffe
rent nomenclatures but they are probably best known as the glycophorins . Glycophorin C was first is
olated in 1978 Glycophorin C and D are minor sialoglycoproteins contributing to 4% and 1% to the PAS
-positive material and are present at about 2.0 and 0.5 x 10 5 copies/cell respectively . In polyacr
ylimide gels glycophorin C 's apparent weight is 32 kilodaltons ( 32 kDa ) . Its structure is simila
r to that of other glycophorins : a highly glycoslated extracellular domain ( residues 1-58 ) , a tr
ansmembrane domain ( residues 59-81 ) and an intracellular domain ( residues 82-128 ) . About 90% of
 the glycophorin C present in the erythrocyte is within the membrane . Glycophorin D 's apparent mol
ecular weight is 23kDa . On average this protein has 6 O linked oligosaccarides per molecule . Withi
n the erythrocyte it interacts with band 4.1 ( an 80-kDa protein ) and p55 ( a palmitoylated periphe
