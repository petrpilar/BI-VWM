host cell genes . This can happen , for example , when a recombinant DNA fragment containing an acti
ve promoter becomes located next to a previously silent host cell gene , or when a host cell gene th
at functions to restrain gene expression undergoes insertional inactivation by recombinant DNA .Appl
ications of recombinant DNA technologyRecombinant DNA is widely used in biotechnology , medicine and
 research . Today , recombinant proteins and other products that result from the use of rDNA technol
ogy are found in essentially every western pharmacy , doctor 's or veterinarian 's office , medical 
testing laboratory , and biological research laboratory . In addition , organisms that have been man
ipulated using recombinant DNA technology , as well as products derived from those organisms , have 
found their way into many farms , supermarkets , home medicine cabinets , and even pet genetically m
odified animals . The most common application of recombinant DNA is in basic research , in which the
