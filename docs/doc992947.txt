 rehearses Largo al Factotum fromThe Barber of Seville. Overhearing Bugs , he absent-mindedly finds 
himself singing along in operatic style : What do they do in Mississippi when skies are drippy ? . R
ealizing that he accidentally switched genres , Giovanni loses his temper over his rehearsal being i
nterrupted in this manner . Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs and breaks the banjo strings and the ban
jo itself in half , crushing the neck and then slamming the body over Bugs ' head . ( Music-hater , 
he hears Bugs singing My Gal Is a High-Born Lady and playing a harp . He tries to ignore Bugs , but

 Giovanni angrily confronts Bugs once again . He grabs Bugs by the throat , puts him in the harp , a
nd crushes his neck inside the harp like a vise . ( Also a rabbit-hater , Bugs counters . ) As Giova
