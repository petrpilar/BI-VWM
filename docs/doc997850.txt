 derivative of any everywhere differentiable function is aG subset of the real line . By definition 
, for any Pompeiu function this set is adenseG  set , therefore by the Baire category theorem it is 
a residual set . In particular , it possesses uncountably many points . A linear combinationaf(x) +b
g(x) of Pompeiu functions is a derivative , and vanishes on the setf= 0g= 0 , which is a denseG by t
he Baire category theorem . Thus , Pompeiu functions are a vector space of functions . A limit funct
