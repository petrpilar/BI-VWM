 could be tuned to produce thrust in any direction . For instance , to lift off vertically the airfo
ils were pitched to have a positive angle of attack only at the top of their rotation , just generat
ing lift only at that point . In forward flight the angle at the top of the arc would be reduced to 
make the lift neutral , but they would retain their positive angle even through the forward part of 
angle in this fashion , the aircraft could be lifted in any direction , with differential thrust bet
ween the two wings allowing yaw to be applied . Caldwell formed Gravity Aeroplane Company in Reno , 
Nevada ( Caldwell was living in Santa Monica at the time ) and issued stock in 1928 . Their company 
stationary included an illustration showing the cyclogyro , a version with four airfoils per wing , 
attached on the fuselage end to a large disk and the outer end to a cross-like support .OrnithopterC
