sed video quality metric used for block-matching in motion estimation for video compression . It wor
ks by taking a frequency transform , usually a Hadamard transform , of the differences between the p

e transform itself is often of a small block rather than the entire macroblock . For example , in x2
64 , a series of 4&amptimes 4 blocks are transformed rather than doing the more processor-intensive 
16&amptimes 16 transform .Comparison to other metricsSATD is slower than the sum of absolute differe
nces ( SAD ) , both due to its increased complexity and the fact that SAD-specific MMX and SSE2 inst
