um chlorate , Ba ( ClO 3 ) 2 , is a white crystalline solid , the barium salt of chloric acid . It i
s an irritant and toxic , as are all soluble barium compounds . It is sometimes used in pyrotechnics
 to produce a green color . It also finds use in the production of chloric acid .ReactionsSynthesis 
Barium chlorate can be produced through a double replacement reaction between solutions of barium ch
loride and sodium chlorate : : BaCl 2 + 2 NaClO 3 Ba ( ClO 3 ) 2 + 2 NaCl On concentrating and chill
ing the resulting mixture , barium chlorate precipitates . This is perhaps the most common preparati
on , exploiting the lower solubility of barium chlorate compared to sodium chlorate . The above meth
od does result in some sodium contamination , which is undesirable for pyrotechnic purposes , green
