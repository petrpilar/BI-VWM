n a filing with the Maryland Securities and Exchange Commission he described the company as working 
solely on a new type of autogyro , which he referred to as a disk-rotor plane . The design consisted
 of a fairly conventional autogyro layout , but the wing was disk-like instead of the more tradition
al helicopter-like bladed assembly . The disk had airfoils formed out of fabric on the inside of the
 rim , and four small solid surfaces on the outside . In forward motion the airstream blowing across
 the four small surfaces would spin the disk , which would provide lift from the fabric airfoils be 
braked to stop it spinning , and unbraked again for a near-vertical landing . The advantage to this 
arrangement was that there was no theoretical limit on forward speed , whereas a conventional autogy
ro can not be stopped in flight , and has a limit when the speed of the rearward moving blade approa
ches the stall speed . Unlike his previous attempts , the disk-rotor aircraft was actually completed
