 the subfamily Tortricinae of the family Tortricidae.DetailsThe moth genusWilliella, family Tortrici
dae , subfamily Tortricinae , was established in 1984 to accommodate two newly-described species fro
m New Caledonia :Williella sauteriandWilliella angulata.Williellawas tentatively assigned to the bas
e of the Archipini . Phylogenetic analysis of their plesiomorphic morphology suggested thatWilliella
species are members of a group of isolated and generalized moths from Australia , New Zealand and So
uth America . The discovery of the genus in New Caledonia suggested that these plesiomorphic modern 
Tortricinae are isolated descendants of a group of very generalized Tortricinae that were distribute
d throughout the Gondwana supercontinent before it broke up into many of the main modern landmasses
